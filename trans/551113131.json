It is on the Qianmen Pedestrian Street. You can walk to Beijing Square for meals. You can find everything you need.\nThere is a subway station about 200 meters from the entrance of the hotel, and there is a convenience store next door. Shopping, eating, and traveling are all very convenient\nI booked a duplex room, and there are bathrooms above and below, which is very user-friendly. Registration at the front desk is understaffed, and the speed is a bit slow. It is a bit troublesome to reverse the elevator back and forth in the next building of the duplex room.\nThe hotel has a rich variety of breakfast, which is very good in general, and will stay again next time"}]},"ServerData":null}
