The room is pitifully small, I was shocked when I entered the door, two people seemed crowded\n2. The TV is quite big, just like the bed, but it's not easy to use. I don't know if I can't use it, but I can't watch it in the middle of the night.\n3. After staying for two nights, the cleaning in the middle was just changing the trash towels and slippers, and basically nothing else. I didn't draw out the paper, and I didn't fill it up. There was no paper to use when I came back.\n4. My friend got a lot of red rashes after sleeping ðŸ™‚\n5. The door is not working well, and the strength of breastfeeding is used to open and close the door, with a bang,\n6. The bathroom curtain cannot be closed and the door cannot be pulled, it has to be pulled from the outside, and someone else has to pull it from the outside when you get out, otherwise you wonâ€™t be able to get out\n7. You can hear the sound outside the window, which is quite loud\n8. The decoration style is very good, it is the type I like."}]},"ServerData":null}
