Except for the bed and the aisle in the bathroom and shower, it only covers an area of 2 square meters, which is not worthy of the 4-star positioning!\nSecond, the bed is next to the window. It doesn't matter whether there is a window or not, and when two people check in, the person who sleeps near the window must disturb the other person's sleep when he gets out of bed!\nThird, the hotel only provides breakfast for one person, even if you are two people! Either you spend 69 yuan to buy another breakfast, or drive you away!\nFourth, there are very few places to eat around the hotel, which is very inconvenient.\nFor the same price, you can choose other better hotels!"}]},"ServerData":null}
