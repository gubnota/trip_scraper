The reason for the relatively high occupancy rate is that there are a lot of things left in the hotel, and the service is not fast enough. The only few tastes are okay\nThe environment of the hotel lobby is not bad, you can receive guests and temporarily work,\nThe room is relatively small, and the window of the superior double room is also very small. The bathroom is above the standard, and there is a heated towel rack, which is good."}]},"ServerData":null}
