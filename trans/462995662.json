Although the size of the room is small, it is understandable in such a place where every inch of land is expensive. The facilities are complete and the location is convenient. It's on the Qianmen Street Pedestrian Street, next to Dashilan, and to the north is Zhengyangmen. It's also very close to Tiananmen, a 20-minute walk. Next time I come to Beijing, I will choose here again."}]},"ServerData":null}
