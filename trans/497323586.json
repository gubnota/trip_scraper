I checked in yesterday and saw that the glass in the bathroom was broken. It didn’t affect the normal use, so I didn’t say anything, and I didn’t ask to change the room. Ctrip called me today and said the glass was broken. I returned it to the hotel when it was over. I made a phone call, I explained the reason, and then I said yes, I hung up the phone before I finished speaking, what do you mean? I feel like I owe her a bit of disrespect to be honest...other services are ok"}]},"ServerData":null}
