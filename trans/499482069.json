The window of this big bed room is next to the corridor, and it actually leads to the room... It's too stuffy, and the room smells bad when you get close to it. The room is on the first floor of another building. You have to go up and down the third floor to get to the lobby on the other side. It is too inconvenient to travel, and the guides are not well done. I almost couldn't find the room. Will not book this again."}]},"ServerData":null}
