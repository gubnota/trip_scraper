It is more convenient to live with children. The single bed is widened, so it is no problem to sleep two people. The lighting, air conditioning, curtains and TV in the house can all be controlled by mobile phone. Downstairs is Qianmen Pedestrian Street, and it is not too far to walk to the square to watch the flag raising. The overall feeling is that it is a good choice in a place where every inch of land is very expensive at the front door."}]},"ServerData":null}
