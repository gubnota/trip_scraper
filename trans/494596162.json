It is very safe to live in the city center. Although the room is small, it is well-equipped. Although it is in a commercial street, it is quiet in the middle of the noise. It is very, very suitable for living alone. The bed is super comfortable, and the fatigue is swept away after sleeping until dawn. The next day, I went to the pageone bookstore from Qianmen Pedestrian Street, rode a bicycle in the alley to Sanlihe Park, and then returned to the hotel. It was so comfortable."}]},"ServerData":null}
