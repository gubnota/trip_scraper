The room is indeed relatively small, but although the sparrow is small and well-equipped, the layout is reasonable, and you won't feel stuffy when you live in it. If you book a room with a view, there is a big balcony, and you can see Qianmen Street downstairs. Ctrip points gave me double breakfast for a few days. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, not amazing but not bad. You can eat enough. There is a Lawson at the door, and it is very convenient to buy food~ Anyway, I am very satisfied. I will still choose to go to Beijing in the future. to go"}]},"ServerData":null}
