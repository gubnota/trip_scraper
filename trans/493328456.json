There is air conditioning, no smoke smell. But the shower room is connected to the toilet, in fact, there is an indelible toilet smell. But ¥500/night is on Qianmen Street in Beijing, so that’s it. I don't want to change hotels either. There are many places to eat in the surrounding streets. The morning is not bad, especially good, the soy milk is good, and the quality is not bad. There is a convenience store next to it, so it is very convenient to buy food. It is also a good helper to save money."}]},"ServerData":null}
