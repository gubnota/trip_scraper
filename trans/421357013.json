The environment and the location are pretty good. I really don't have to say anything about the location. It's very convenient, and the sanitation is also very clean. Although the room is small, it is equipped with all necessary facilities. I hope it can be improved. The sound of the sanitary aunt opening and closing the door is too loud, and it must ring at 8 o'clock in the morning every day"}]},"ServerData":null}
