The location is very good. It's very close to the subway station. It's just around the corner. It's very convenient to go everywhere, and it's also very convenient to call a car. The hotel is on the third ring road, and there is a Phoenix Plaza nearby. It's a short walk. Only minutes away, you can go to Vientiane Mall for eating and shopping. The breakfast is very rich, until eleven o'clock, so we basically only eat two meals a day, and breakfast can be eaten until noon. There are two small episodes. One is that the bracelet was left in the room when checking out, and it was only after eating that I remembered that the waiter had already cleaned up the room and the bracelet had been placed at the front desk. The second is that I went to the Great Wall early, and the breakfast hadn't started yet, so the front desk staff went to the kitchen to pack bread, yogurt and apples for me. So I have to give a good review, and I will still live here next time I go to Beijing."}]},"ServerData":null}
