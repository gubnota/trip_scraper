After all, you can find more than 400 hotels near Tiananmen. The location is on the pedestrian street. The front door is Tiananmen in the past. It is a good choice to watch the flag-raising ceremony. If you can’t visit Tiananmen after 9 pm, you have to walk a long way. You can go to Tiananmen Square by going around the underground passage. The only advantage is that there are very few people, and you can get through the security check in a few seconds. You don’t need to take pictures of people’s heads. The front throat of the hotel is subway line 2 and line 7. There is still a memorial archway in Qianmen Bus hub station, excellent location"}]},"ServerData":null}
