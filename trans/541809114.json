Room service is also very enthusiastic. The room is small, but comfortable to live in. What I don't like is that the bath and toilet are transparent! !\nThe transportation location is very convenient.

The hotel is on Qianmen Street, convenient for shopping and eating. Beijing needs jiojio for traveling by car or visiting scenic spots, so it is very important to wear a pair of light and comfortable shoes..."}]},"ServerData":null}
