After I came to the hotel, I asked if the platinum member could upgrade the room. The waiter said that the room could be upgraded, and told the upgrade was completed. When we got to the room, we found that it was a 1.5-meter small bed I couldn‚Äôt sleep in the room with children. Then I went downstairs to ask the waiter, and she didn‚Äôt upgrade the room. She just told us a room with a window of 1.5 meters. Now there is no big bed of 1.8 meters. Later, I I'm a little angry, if you can't upgrade, don't agree, we can still live in a double bed room, and now it is very annoying to deny it, but fortunately a girl came and changed us to a 1.8-meter double bed. If you agree, don't deny it, the front desk gave a gift before leaving üéÅ This praise is for her."}]},"ServerData":null}
