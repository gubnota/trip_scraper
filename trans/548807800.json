The location is the most satisfying point\n\nðŸ””Service: The attitude of the front desk is very good, and they will say hello when they enter and leave.\n\nNext, enter the Tucao section\nThe room is really very, very small. The big bed room I booked at the beginning felt like two adults could lie flat and end up lying flat. There is no difference between whether there are inner windows or not. So when we entered the front desk, we asked if we wanted to upgrade. 200+ was added in the back to upgrade the outer windows, the room is still very small and there is no place to walk with two suitcases laid flat, and there is no light in one area of the bed, it is very dark.\n\nBut what makes me unhappy is that we booked the same room with our friends, and they got a bigger room at a price of 400+ less than us. At the beginning, we asked if the big bed room was this big. Itâ€™s basic, but our room couldnâ€™t even fit the sofa, and there were two small sofas in my friendâ€™s room.\n\nIn summary, I am not very satisfied with the check-in experience, but if you are looking for the convenience of traveling around, you can still choose this hotel."}]},"ServerData":null}
