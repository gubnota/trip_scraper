Walking out of the hotel is Qianmen Street Pedestrian Street. A family of four booked a parent-child room, and grandparents booked a room with a balcony. We have a little space to play with wooden horses. The bed is 2.0*2.0, and the child is still young. I was in Beijing for 6 days and 5 Best night's sleep. Although the room of my grandparents has a balcony, the space is very small. Except for the balcony, there is basically no room for activities, and my grandma complained about it."}]},"ServerData":null}
