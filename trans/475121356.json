But the sound insulation of the room is too bad, the residents in the next room are so loud that the special effects of the stereo sound come out every night; it is estimated that my room was cleaned in a hurry and the toilet is not clean; the doors and windows cannot be locked and it is confusing; The room is so hot that the inner window is not turned on and the heating is not turned on. If you live in it, you must wear short sleeves. But at this price, other hardware equipment can't be changed. What can be improved is hygiene and safety."}]},"ServerData":null}
