Although the room is not very big, it is clean and well-equipped, suitable for business trips and tourism. There are 4 bottles of purified water in the room, which is very considerate for guests who are not used to the dryness in the north. I forgot to use the mouse when I checked out, and Mei at the front desk called to confirm that the courier would be delivered to me. The service can be said to be very thoughtful and considerate. I will choose this hotel for my next business trip or tourism."}]},"ServerData":null}
