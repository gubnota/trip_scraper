It’s just that the hotel room is really small. When you enter the door, the bed is facing you. We specially booked a room with a window, and then gave us a room with only a door. The door is facing the bed. It’s not safe to sleep with it open. Contact the front desk The solution given is also quite disappointing. The room is very cold when the air conditioner is turned on, and the temperature is turned up a bit and it is very hot. I really don't accept the room without windows. Didn't sleep well all night. . The breakfast is very good, there are many varieties and the taste is very good."}]},"ServerData":null}
