Although the room size is small, the facilities are very complete. Many of the designs are ingenious, do not take up space, and are very convenient to use. I would like to give the designer a thumbs up for taking the time to understand the residents. The whole is also very clean, thorough and bright, and the style is very suitable for young people. It's fine for one person, but it's a bit crowded for two people (if there is a larger room type). The location of the hotel is good, next to the Sanyuanqiao subway station, it is very convenient to go to the airport."}]},"ServerData":null}
