The overall environment is very good, the room is clean, and it feels very bright after turning on the lights. The lights in the bathroom and shower room are sensory. Press The switch controls the curtains and screens (the lifting speed is a little slow), the bed is soft and comfortable, there are free bottled water and drinks, there is a laundry room and a gym downstairs (relatively small, with dumbbells, bicycles and treadmills)\nBut I feel that there is still room for further improvement. The room is not too big overall. It would be nice to have a cabinet for hanging clothes and trousers. In addition, the sound insulation effect of the door is average, and other people in the corridor can still hear clearly. In addition, it would be better if the variety of breakfast can be enriched\nOverall, the price/performance ratio of this hotel is still very high, and it is very comfortable to live in. I will continue to choose it when I travel in the future"}]},"ServerData":null}
