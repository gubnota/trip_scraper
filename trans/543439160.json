It is facing Sparkle Roll International. The transportation is convenient. The layout of the room is very good. The mattress and pillows are very comfortable and soft. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. They took the initiative to see us dragging our big suitcases Helped me take my luggage to the room, and also sent our children's toiletry set. The music in the lobby is very nice. I especially like the simple and trendy design style. The super large TV screen can also be used for projection. All in all, the experience is great!"}]},"ServerData":null}
