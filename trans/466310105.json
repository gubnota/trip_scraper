It is just on Qianmen Street. It takes only 3 minutes to walk to Zhushikou Station of Line 7. It is only 3 stops away from Beijing South Railway Station. The transportation is convenient, and it is very convenient to go anywhere. It’s just that there may be renovations next to it, and the noise of the renovations is quite loud. There are renovation workers outside the window. They don’t dare to open the windows. There is no refrigerator in the room. I don’t know if we didn’t find it. The air conditioner can’t adjust the hot air. It’s still quite cold at night in this season ."}]},"ServerData":null}
