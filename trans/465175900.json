I took a fancy to this one. It is 2-3 minutes walk from Exit D of Sanyuanqiao Metro. Very convenient. Because I live alone, I booked a big bed room. The room is very clean, free mineral water and Coke Sprite are provided every day. Because I drink a lot of water, I stayed for 4 consecutive days and put more and more mineral water every day, which is so considerate. The hotel can order meals, but there are few choices. I only had dinner at the hotel once. I ordered hamburger fries and beer. After ordering and paying, I waited in the room, and a robot would deliver it to my door. If you order takeaway, the takeaway brother will also put the meal in the box next to the front desk, and you can just go down and pick it up yourself. The play settings and public space downstairs are very large, suitable for three or five friends to sit and chat. The curtains and screens in the room are all electric switches, and the curtains are very, very good at blackout. Overall it's really great. I will recommend friends to live here, and if I go to Beijing again, I will consider staying again."}]},"ServerData":null}
