The shower gel, shampoo, body lotion are as complete, and there is a scent of orange blossom, which is really loved by people like me who are more particular about washing and care. There is also a lot of space in the room, and all kinds of beds are also comfortable. The air in the room is also fragrant. It also has a super loudspeaker. Wow, wow, it's not much better than the citigo I stayed in last time. In the future, I still have to choose a well-known hotel chain, which is guaranteed.\nBreakfast is also really good, Chinese food and Western food. It is also very humane, and it will not say that you will not be allowed to enter after the meal closes at ten o'clock. The parking lot at the location of the hotel is also very large"}]},"ServerData":null}
