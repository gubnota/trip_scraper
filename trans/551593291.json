This is a modification of the original Ibis hotel. The small disadvantage is that the size of the room is too small. For people with large suitcases, it will take up part of the room and there is less space for activities.\nThe bar downstairs is a feature and very helpful for business.\nThe ingredients for breakfast and the choice of dishes are also good, which is in line with the taste of business. The overall impression is good, next time you come to Beijing on business, you will still give priority to it."}]},"ServerData":null}
