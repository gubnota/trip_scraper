Although the area is small, it doesn't feel oppressive at all. Instead, it feels convenient and warm. The color tone makes people feel very comfortable, and the magnificent lobby has a feeling of beautiful mountains and green waters. I don't have the habit of taking pictures, but the design is really worth learning;\nAnother highlight is the breakfast. The tofu nao, croissant, fried egg, chicken popcorn coffee, and watermelon are all the best standard that you can eat outside.\nThe front desk may be too busy, and the tone seems to be trying to suppress the impatient attitude, but the demand is still answered, and it is also praised"}]},"ServerData":null}
