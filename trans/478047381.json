Hansgrohe bathrooms, Duravit toilets and Geberit pumps, and custom-made mineral water from Bamaboquan. These configurations can be compared with five-star hotels, and they are also in line with the hotel's own luxury positioning. The useless bathtub, sofa, desk and oversized space are omitted, and the price is right, which is very suitable for traveling alone. I didn't experience the hotel's breakfast, but there are Ruixing and Lawson next to it. It is very convenient to solve the breakfast when traveling."}]},"ServerData":null}
