Because I had just undergone an operation and was physically inconvenient, the hotel receptionist helped to arrange for a male waiter in the restaurant to take me to Qinghe Railway Station on an electric scooter, and there was no charge. I was very touched! The hotel can help the guests so selflessly. In my opinion, the humanistic care is extremely good. I believe that both the hotel and these two staff members will have a bright future. Bless you, thank you! grateful!"}]},"ServerData":null}
