The bed was soft and the front desk service was good. The food delivery robot on the facility is broken, so it is a bit troublesome to go down to get the food by yourself. At the beginning, there was a problem with the door lock of the room, but it was replaced in a timely manner, which is well received. In the middle of the night, there are free supper small wontons, which is quite warm. The location is very good, the subway station is two steps away, and the airport is super fast."}]},"ServerData":null}
