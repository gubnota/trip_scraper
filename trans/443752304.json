The facilities are very new. The bathroom lights will be automatically sensed. There is a mobile phone holder. The light source is dark and suitable for rest. But some supporting things need to be improved. For example, there is no other tea or coffee in the room except for two small bottles of water, so you can only go to the lobby to enjoy it. The air conditioner in the room is blowing directly on the head, and it must be turned off after a while, otherwise it will be unbearable. Breakfast is a buffet, so it's no problem to be full. It was introduced that the room is fully intelligent and controllable by mobile phone. As a result, it can only be enjoyed by paying members, which is disappointing. Therefore, in combination with other hotels, the price is relatively high, and 200 yuan less is a reasonable price."}]},"ServerData":null}
