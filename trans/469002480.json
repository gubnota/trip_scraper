It is very convenient to visit Dashilan and Xianyukou at night. We even upgraded to a duplex room. Although the sparrow is small, it has all the internal organs. Very good choice in this place where every inch of land is very expensive. The service of the hotel is really good, the staff are polite and enthusiastic, responsive to every request. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. The only regret is that the shower room is too small, and the shower is made of frosted glass. It would be embarrassing if my colleagues are on a business tripðŸ˜“"}]},"ServerData":null}
