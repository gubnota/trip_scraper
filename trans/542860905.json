My mobile phone does not support wireless charging. The plug in the room is connected to USB A. It happens that the data cable I brought is broken, and the phone is dead. Ask the front desk that there is only one dual type C, which is completely useless. The hotels I stayed in before are basically equipped with three-in-one data cables in the rooms, which gives this hotel a bad review. The room is not big, and it is basically impossible to get out of the box when it is spread out. There is no place to hang towels and clothes in the bathroom, which is inconvenient. Will not choose again."}]},"ServerData":null}
