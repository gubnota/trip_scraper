The only advantage of this hotel is that it is very close to the subway entrance, and it takes only five minutes to walk there. But the price is much more expensive than similar hotels, even a little more expensive than some five-star hotels, and breakfast is not included. The room is very small. The family room I booked must be bigger than the twin room. It said 17 square meters on the Internet, but I didn't pay much attention. As a result, as soon as they entered the room, the two of them didn't even have a place to stay, and they couldn't move around with their luggage on the ground. The first feeling is that when we arrive in Hong Kong, it is smaller than hotels in Hong Kong. The bathroom and shower room are separated. The washbasin is not in the bathroom, but in the room. Originally, it was not easy for two people to walk around, and the feeling of washing next to the bed was uncomfortable. The front desk of this hotel feels like a bar, and the waiters also feel like bartenders, which feels weird. There was a problem with the computer when I checked in, and I waited for a long time, but I didn't see the waiter give me some water. In a word, I don't like it very much, and I won't live again."}]},"ServerData":null}
