After checking in, I feel really great and have a strong sense of design, whether it is color or function; the most important thing is the service and quality that the hotel should reflect. The feeling of living, the service attitude of the overall staff is very good, enthusiastic and professional, the lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic and even upgraded the room, and I made two bookings of different levels, but she still specially helped me unify the room to avoid the trouble of changing rooms, and The little brother at the bar carefully reminded us that the hot water was too hot, and helped us clean up the table, even if it wasnâ€™t from the hotel, he was very enthusiastic; by the way, the hotel also provides small wonton stew for supper, and the chef is the same, with a friendly attitude and delicious food ;Very recommendable hotel. Finally, the location is very close to the subway, and you don't need to change lines to go directly to the airport! The intelligent robot likes it very much, and I hope the hotel will continue to maintain it!"}]},"ServerData":null}
