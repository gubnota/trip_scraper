The state and service of the public area exceed most business hotels of the same level. There are also seats outdoors, and the environment is very good. The room space is a bit small and there are many small ideas, but the mattress and bedding are good. The advantage is that the location of the hotel is very good, it is quiet in the middle of the noise, and it is very convenient to go everywhere. The overall cost performance is still very high. There are shopping malls and commercial streets nearby, and there is a Black Pearl restaurant across the road, which is a surprise."}]},"ServerData":null}
