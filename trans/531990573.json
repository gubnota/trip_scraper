The gate is right next to the big fence. To be precise, it is surrounded by the big fence. The room is okay, but the window facing the street is a bit noisy. It is not recommended for those who like quietness. If you come to travel and want to see the street scene of old Beijing, it is highly recommended."}]},"ServerData":null}
