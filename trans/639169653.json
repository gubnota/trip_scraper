What must be praised is the lichen breakfast at 2:00, which is served from the morning until 12:00. There is also a free supper at night. This is the most heart-warming service in my opinion.

There is a Lawson convenience store downstairs in the subway station￼￼￼￼￼In the room, in addition to providing ordinary mineral water, it also provides soda water and sugar-free cola, which is the same as my own configuration, which is a surprise!\nIf the only thing that is bad about him is that the TV does not have internet. . As a smart TV, it is pure decoration￼￼￼￼…"}]},"ServerData":null}
