Checked out on the morning of November 16th. At that time, there were two waiters who checked out in the hands of the short waiter. The service was cold, and the invoice was impatient. Then the young man who checked out behind me issued an invoice for him, and took the initiative to put the invoice in an envelope and hand it to the customer with both hands. The service contrast is very large, and it is suspected of discriminating against elderly customers, which is uncomfortable. I also bought breakfast from this waiter. The service was also cold, and I didn't answer any more questions. Hope the hotel will strengthen management and improve the service awareness of the waiters."}]},"ServerData":null}
