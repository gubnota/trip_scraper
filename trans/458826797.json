The location is on Qianmen Street! Going out to the overpass is the subway station, which is super convenient👀👍 and there is a taxi and bicycle parking place 30 meters away from the hotel’s main entrance. The parking place is very nice👏\n2. I personally think that the breakfast is absolutely worth the price of 69! Rich and fresh fruits, small cakes 🍰 bread 🍞 various drinks, American Chinese noodles 🍜 and everything 🤔\n3. The room is clean and odorless, with good exhaust and low noise. The bed is very comfortable. Extra beds are not allowed. The overall design is user-friendly. The normal single room has three pillows hhh I love it. The decoration has a sense of design, which is exactly in line with the merchant's pictures 👍For the twin-bed room, the merchant designed the placement of futons between the two beds! ! very interesting\n4. Roll call and praise the little brother at the front desk hhh is super responsible! The room problem has been actively communicated with us. We arrived at the store around three o'clock in the middle of the night, and we are still very warm and nice🤔👍\nAll in all, it is really recommended to stay.\nThe same price is definitely the king of cost performance."}]},"ServerData":null}
