There is also a free late night snack at 10pm! The sound insulation is good. The only regret is that the air conditioner is a central air conditioner, and the temperature cannot be adjusted. The room temperature is 25 degrees and it is indeed a bit hot. The air outlet of the air conditioner is facing the bed, and it doesn't blow heat, and it is uncomfortable to blow directly on the air outlet. 3 minutes away from Exit D of Sanyuan Bridge, very convenient!"}]},"ServerData":null}
