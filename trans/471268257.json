Every time I go back to the room, I have to go through the lobby of the main building, go up the elevator, walk over the bridge on the third floor, and then take the elevator to the next floor. It is very troublesome, so I asked the front desk to change the room and change to the second floor of the main building. Floor heating on the upper and lower floors plus heating, and the dark window is really unacceptable. I called the front desk and said that I could send a fan up, but after an hour, I didnâ€™t see it, so I called the front desk again to ask for the room number, but I heard another voice on the other end of the phone. A staff member said very loudly, \"What's wrong with xxxx (room number)?\" I originally wanted to ask which employee is so qualified, but I don't want to affect my mood when I go out to travel so I don't want to make a big deal. I hope that If you can't do it, you can change careers. The service industry may not be suitable for you. The young lady who answered our phone was very nice and patient. She took us to see the room with a window and helped us do it. The most favorable way to upgrade can only be said to be in sharp contrast to the previous ones. In addition, the cleaning lady in the room is also good, so the mood is not affected too much. The location of the hotel is also very convenient. There is a coffee shop next to the convenience store. There is a food street nearby. The subway entrance is also very close. It takes 1-2 minutes to walk to the subway entrance. Overall, it is good. Just be careful to choose a room with windows, otherwise you may suffer from heat stroke in winter"}]},"ServerData":null}
