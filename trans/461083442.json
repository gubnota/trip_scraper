I didn't have much hope. In addition, I arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock in the evening. I really want to praise this hotel.\n1. Location: Located in front of Qianmen Pedestrian Street, very convenient, very convenient, very convenient.\n2. Room: I was surprised, every detail is a surprise, very considerate, although the room is not big, but the decoration is really like it. For example, hiding the luggage rack, such as the super intimate bedside lamp, I canâ€™t wait to move it home, haha\n3. Service: Although I arrived at the store very late, the waiter has a super nice personality, and the two who look at the store seem to be two brothers and sisters.\n4. Bed: super comfortable, pay attention to the bed, strongly recommended"}]},"ServerData":null}
