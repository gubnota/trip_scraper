So I came back again without hesitation. After two years, the service is still great, but the hardware facilities are not as good as before. The partition behind the toilet in the bathroom will make a noise when the door is opened or closed, and the water temperature from the shower head is not very high. Bathroom The lights are sensory. I don't know why it turns black after half of the washing. The floor in the washing area is also uneven, but the staff is still very nice and will solve any problems in a timely manner, and greet each other when they come in and out! The location is really convenient. There is a subway station at the door. It is very convenient to be away from Tiananmen Dashilan. You can choose according to your needs."}]},"ServerData":null}
