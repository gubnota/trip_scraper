I was quite worried when I saw the bad reviews before. Overall, itâ€™s okay. The room is not too small and can meet basic needs. The location is convenient. It takes about 20 minutes to go to Tiananmen Square to watch the flag raising, and visit Qianmen to check in at Deyun Club The time-honored brands are very convenient."}]},"ServerData":null}
