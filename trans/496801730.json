When taking a bath, I asked my husband to take the baby to the lobby to wait. And after washing the floor is full of water! The sound insulation of the room is not good, so you can sleep with earplugs at night. Maybe there are more people during the holidays and there is no service to speak of. The only plus point is the location."}]},"ServerData":null}
