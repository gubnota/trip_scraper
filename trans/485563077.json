It is very, very close to the Sanyuanqiao Airport Line. There is also Phoenix Shopping Mall and a sunken living community nearby. There are also many restaurants and supermarkets in it, which is very convenient. The decoration of the hotel is very distinctive. Those who like to check in and take pictures must not miss it (although I didn't have time to take pictures ðŸ˜‚âœ¨). Although the room is not big, it has everything you need. I especially like the minibar, which has both diet Coke and regular Coke. The front desk staff was also very enthusiastic and upgraded the room for free. Ah, also, the bed is very comfortable, and the decoration on the wall is also very special, although the English font is too difficult to read hahaha. In short, if there is a need in the future, I will come to live again!"}]},"ServerData":null}
