This time I stay for a longer time and I feel more. Some hotel rooms are well organized and clean, and the laundry and drying are free. It is so convenient, and the washing is still very dry. The net breakfast is until twelve o'clock, which is also considerate. Supper and free small wontons are also very good. The standard of 400 yuan is considered very cost-effective in this location in Beijing."}]},"ServerData":null}
