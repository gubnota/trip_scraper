The night manager was also great, we had a few minor issues and he was very busy and dealt with them in a timely manner. All in all, the service is good. For the room, the bathroom is too slippery, it is recommended to put some anti-slip mats. The lights were a little off and the room was dark. All in all it was a very pleasant stay"}]},"ServerData":null}
