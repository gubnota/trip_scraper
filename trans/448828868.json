First of all, let's talk about the service. Three big people stood at the front desk for a long time and no one received them. Secondly, let's talk about the service. The room that can be checked in at 12:00 has not been cleaned at 16:30; finally, let's talk about the environment and facilities. The lobby of the building is indeed suitable for taking pictures, but the quality of sleep is still important when traveling. The room is small and the sound insulation is poor. If you have expectations for the quality of sleep, don't think about it. The room next door sang songs most of the night, and it was so noisy that you went downstairs to buy dustproof earplugs. The pillows were either too high or too low and they were hot. The only consolation is the breakfast. The price/performance ratio is much higher than that of budget hotels. The taste is also very nice, and the decoration style of his home is also very fashionable. In short, the service is lost."}]},"ServerData":null}
