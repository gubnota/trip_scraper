You can see that it was designed by a young designer. The layout of the room is reasonable, clean and comfortable, the bed is soft, and the service attitude is very good. This is more suitable for young people to live in, or to live alone. It is not suitable for two people who are over 60 years old. It is not convenient to climb in and out of this bed."}]},"ServerData":null}
