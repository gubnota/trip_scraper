Hotels need to rely on such enthusiastic and communicative waiters, not employees who are eager to check out.\nSpeaking of the convenient location, we had a bit of a discussion this morning, so we called a car to go to the airport, we arrived in less than 20 minutes, and checked in for the plane."}]},"ServerData":null}
