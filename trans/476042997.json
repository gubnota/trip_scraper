The hotel facilities are very new and the design is modern, which is quite in line with the aesthetics of young people. The attitude of the hotel staff is also very good, and they even gave small gifts.\nI was upgraded to a double room with a view. There are two types of double room with a view. I personally recommend that you choose a large room in winter. In winter, the balcony is not very useful and you canâ€™t see any views."}]},"ServerData":null}
