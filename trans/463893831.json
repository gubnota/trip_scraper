The subway station is just at the door, turn right for 100 meters, Line 7. Next to Lawson, it is convenient to buy everything. The breakfast in the hotel is very good. I upgraded the duplex family room with extra money. It is necessary to bring children. Both bathrooms can take a shower. If I come to Beijing in the future, I will still consider staying here!"}]},"ServerData":null}
