Upstairs room was hot, downstairs was cold. In front of the floor-to-ceiling windows is the road with people and cars passing by. I feel that there is no privacy and poor sound insulation.\nThe parent-child room is very small. The only toys are a wooden horse and a tent that can easily collapse. The baby's white socks turn black after playing in the ground for a while.\nIt is a house in an alley, and the two rooms are facing another building. I can't see anything except the room opposite, and I dare not open the curtains in the room. The experience of living in the alley is not very good"}]},"ServerData":null}
