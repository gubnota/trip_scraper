The heating is sufficient, and the windows are open for ventilation, so I am generally satisfied. It takes about 18 minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square. There are a lot of food around, which is more convenient. The bathroom is transparent, so it doesn't matter if you travel as a family."}]},"ServerData":null}
