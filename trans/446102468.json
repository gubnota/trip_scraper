The reply said that this room type is just like this. This time I stayed in the king room with a view, and found that the bathroom has the same layout. The hotel overall is good. The breakfast is very good, but the king room with a view on the fourth floor is not recommended. There is a terrace but no view And there is a flight of stairs to walk. The stairs are airtight and smell great."}]},"ServerData":null}
