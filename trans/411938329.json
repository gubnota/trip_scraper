The bathroom is very small and must be separated from wet and dry, and the desk should be arranged as comfortably as possible and not placed casually. The bedside sockets are complete, and the lights are also very good. There is a small light that can be turned on with just a touch of your hand, so it is convenient to get up at night in a daze. If someone shares the bed, they won't bother. It doesn't matter if the curtains are closed, it is indeed dark and it is easy to fall asleep when the curtains are opened during the day. The bed is big enough and the bedding is comfortable. I am very satisfied at this price."}]},"ServerData":null}
