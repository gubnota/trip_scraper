The security guard and the front desk did not ask what services they needed, nor did they introduce the facilities in the lobby. Instead, they followed me and harassed me continuously. When I gave up in a hurry and went to the elevator to go upstairs, they were pestered and asked for my room number in a punitive tone. It seems that I can't enjoy the facilities in the lobby, or I still have some shady identity. I really can't bear this kind of suspicion.\n\nTo be fair, the hotel's location and facilities are good, and the aunt and elder brother who clean the room are also very friendly, but now this incident makes me feel uncomfortable when I walk through the lobby. Booked a room here for a week and now it's really uncomfortable."}]},"ServerData":null}
