My brothers and sisters are very nice, and my aunt is also nice! Hey, I still like CitiGo's bed, it's easy to get sleepy (very useful for people with insomnia), and the windows are also very special, with two layers, one for sun protection and one for complete cover, which can be automatically adjusted at the head of the bed ðŸ˜œ , I hope to come again next time.\nForgot to mention, the bathroom is very bright and clean. As a designer, I still like the layout of this room very much. Anyway, it has a gentle color tone. When you open the door, you can see the warm little quilt in a straight line.
