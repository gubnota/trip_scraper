The location is perfect. It feels like someone is cleaning the public space at any time. I was even more surprised when I entered the room. The equipment is very new and very clean. Overall, the cleanliness is super high . The service attitude at the counter is quite professional, paying attention to every customer. The breakfast part... there are a lot of dishes! You won't get tired of eating it every day. It's really a good deal to live in a hotel with such a quality of service at this price. I had a lot of fun in Beijing during this trip. I was lucky to encounter a snowstorm in Beijing and had a snowball fight. I woke up early in the morning and saw the snow scene from the window was really beautiful... I will want to live here again if I have a chance!\nPs. It is very convenient to have a washing machine downstairs ~ extra points"}]},"ServerData":null}
