The details are well done. The room is really not big, but the space is well utilized and it will be more suitable for young people. I didn't take any photos, but the furniture decoration is better than expected, simple and more textured. It's worth it for the price of more than 300 yuan a night next to the Sanyuanqiao subway. The toilet and shower room are very clean, the floor is non-slip, I like it very much. The bedding is also very comfortable, and there is a mobile phone holder on the side of the bed, haha, it is more suitable for young people. By the way, there are bathrobes in the room, which is rare in a hotel of this price. There is also a laundry room, gym and office space on the first floor, as well as a pool table and foosball table, which is a bit of a shared office.\n\nThe small regret is that I was told that there were free drinks in the refrigerator in the room during breakfast, but the refrigerator was empty for two nights I stayed, and I didn't see any drinks except for the free bottled water on the table. We didn't care about the drinks so we didn't ask. During the epidemic, breakfast should be simpler than usual. 69 yuan per person is really not worth it, but considering that the hotel industry is really not easy during the epidemic, I still hope that this hotel can survive the epidemic and get better and better. Donâ€™t raise the price!"}]},"ServerData":null}
