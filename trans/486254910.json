The subway station is just outside the door. The food nearby is more expensive but they are all time-honored brands. It is enough to try something new when traveling.\nZhang Yiyuan's drink window and ice cream are especially recommended.\nQuanjude in Qianmen is the first restaurant, and the taste of roast duck is completely different from other branches.\nHotel rooms are generally small and dense, but the breakfast is delayed until 12 o'clock, which is great."}]},"ServerData":null}
