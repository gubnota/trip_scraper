The service in the hotel is also very extreme. When you enter the door, the staff will help you with your luggage and check in. There is a cute robot to deliver food when ordering food, and there are free washing machines and dryers on the first floor of the hotel, laundry detergent, disinfectant, and softener are all available! There is also a public office space on the first floor, with sockets and charging treasures, and leisure facilities such as billiard tables and claw machines next to it. There is a minibar in the room, with soft drinks, juices and mineral water, which is very good. Except that the room is a bit small, but I have to say that it is very compact and feels safe!"}]},"ServerData":null}
