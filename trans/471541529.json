This is the first time I have stayed in many hotels. The breakfast can be eaten until 12:00. The hotel room service, hygiene, and decoration style are all very good 👍👍👏 It's not boring to stay in the hotel for a whole day. There is a book bar to read books, and there is billiards... The breakfast is also very rich"}]},"ServerData":null}
