The overall situation in Beijing is worse than that in Shanghai. The laundry room in Shanghai has two sets of suction dryers and treadmills. Where does the Beijing set have to wait for half a day to complete the laundry process! The little brother in the breakfast department is pretty nice and polite! There is a young lady at the front desk who is also very kind and attentive to help pick up and drop off. Thank you very much. The transparent bathroom in the Beijing room is too embarrassing!\n【Free luggage delivery】"}]},"ServerData":null}
