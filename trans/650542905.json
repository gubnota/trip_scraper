The breakfast time is very long from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm. The room service is also very good. There is also beer at the front desk. If you are tired from work, you can have a bottle to relax. The nucleic acid testing point is just a minute away from the house. It is very easy to do nucleic acid testing. Convenience, I will continue to stay again next time, very good experience"}]},"ServerData":null}
