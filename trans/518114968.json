Because there is no fixed view room, I want to see the top floor scenery before leaving. Ms. Zhao Juan at the front desk is very enthusiastic and took me to visit and take pictures. The hotel grows a lot of melons and fruits on the roof, and you can eat them after you pick them off and wash them. I will try them next time."}]},"ServerData":null}
