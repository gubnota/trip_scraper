The location is convenient. It takes less than ten minutes to walk to Taikoo Li. There are many small bars next door.\nThe clerk's service is very good. It turns out that I checked out at 12 o'clock and extended it to 1 o'clock for free.\nThe room facilities are also very good, the minimalist style is fully functional\nNext time I come to Beijing, I will definitely book this place"}]},"ServerData":null}
