This store can do laundry, play billiards, and eat wontons at night. It is also very convenient to make an appointment downstairs. Originally, the location was also full marks, next to the shopping mall, but the subway station happened to be closed this time (including the Airport Express), which affected travel a little. Next time I hope to have a note when placing an order."}]},"ServerData":null}
