First, the hotel only has central air conditioning, which cannot be controlled by itself, and there are only hot air conditioners and no cold air conditioners. After contacting the front desk, an air-conditioning fan was delivered.\nSecond, the roll paper was used up the next day, and no one came to refill it for a total of 5 days and 4 nights. But this is not a problem.\nThe most annoying thing is the last day. When I was leaving, I found that the hat was left in the room and I didn’t pick it up, because I had already boarded the car and went to the airport. I didn’t go back to pick it up. I immediately called the front desk and asked for help to see if I was there. If I was there, please send it by express delivery. Give it to me, he promised with all his mouth, saying that if there is any, he will add WeChat to ask for the address, and if not, he will call me, but there is no more. There is no contact until now, and the hat has not been found. Integrity is problematic."}]},"ServerData":null}
