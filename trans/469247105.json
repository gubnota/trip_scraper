The subway is just three minutes away from the door. There is Lawson downstairs. You can buy all the Beijing specialties you want to buy on this street. The subway and bus are very convenient.\nI booked a room with an inner window, the bed is 1.5m, two small people can sleep without pressure, but the heating is central air-conditioning, it is too hot at night, so I asked the front desk for an electric fan. Toiletries can be found at the front desk."}]},"ServerData":null}
