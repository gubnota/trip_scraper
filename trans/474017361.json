The facilities are advanced, there is a main console to control the lights in the room, and there are many sockets for convenient charging; room service is usually delivered by robots, but hotel meals are average. The rooms are small and so are the beds. What bothers me is that the room I stayed in smelled of second-hand smoke, and sometimes the lobby on the first floor also smells. The service attitude of the front desk staff is OK."}]},"ServerData":null}
