The shower head leaks, and the floor feels a little dirty. Sitting on the bed, you can see a lot of tangled wires at the bottom right of the sink. The TV is not smart. You canâ€™t cast the screen. If you want to watch movies, you only have the most traditional cable TV on demand and you have to pay for it. The mobile phone stand next to the bed is not bad. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast is very rich, complete in variety, and the environment is also good. It is still very good including breakfast worth it"}]},"ServerData":null}
