Adults and children wash up in the morning without disturbing each other, which is very good; the aunt cleans it every day, it is clean and tidy, and when we return to the hotel Very comfortable; the service robot who comes to deliver things is polite and super cute. I only hope that the next time I stay, the water will be as hot as the night when I take a shower in the morning"}]},"ServerData":null}
