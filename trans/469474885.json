Although the room is small, it suits my taste. The decoration design is very modern. The family room is for one person. The bed takes up half the size of the room. There is no pressure to roll around, and you can lie on the bed and watch The TV plays the computer and the mobile phone. You can drink whatever you want in the refrigerator, and Coke is sugar-free. The downside is that there are no tea bags. Downstairs is a barâž•restaurant on the first floor, and there is a free supper at night. Breakfast is good at 7-12 points."}]},"ServerData":null}
