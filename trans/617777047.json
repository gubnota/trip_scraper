I couldn't book the same room type. The room manager was very nice and helped us change rooms and carry our luggage. Since there was no room for the next two days We booked a family room and chose a relatively larger deluxe double room for us, which was big enough for us to live in. Because the environment is at the front door, there is no way to evaluate it according to the normal price/performance ratio, so it is still okay overall! The room facilities are a bit old, but everything else is fine"}]},"ServerData":null}
