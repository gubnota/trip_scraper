The sister at the front desk was quite energetic and even did a free upgrade. I was very surprised when I entered the room. It can be seen that it was newly renovated in the past two years, with wireless charging, convenient central control, and even Bedside lamps and mobile phone holders are thoughtfully set up beside the bed. Unfortunately, the mobile phone holder is a bit loose, but it doesn't hurt. The stay is very comfortable, the hot water comes quickly, there is a curtain to separate the shower room from the bed, and the sense of space It was strong and so was the air conditioner. I am a bartender professional. From a professional and personal point of view, I am very satisfied with my stay. The overall is great, the location of the hotel is also very convenient, definitely will come again."}]},"ServerData":null}
