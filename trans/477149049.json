It takes about one hour and fifteen minutes to Daxing Airport. The decoration of the lobby is very stylish (it was also for this reason that I was attracted to book this hotel), and there are USB sockets.\n\nDisadvantages: 1. The room is very small, even if you specially book the largest room with a balcony, it feels cramped. The balcony is useless in winter, it’s too cold to go out, and the windows can’t be opened, it’s better to book a room with an inner window, which is more than 100 cheaper! To get to the room, you need an elevator to go up to the third floor, and then take the stairs from the third floor to the fourth floor. It is very inconvenient, especially if you are carrying a 28-inch suitcase. The trouble is dead. The hotel did not inform you of this when booking , and the waiter did not offer to help with luggage or something. 2. The bed is very small and uncomfortable to sleep on. 3. The toilet and shower in the room are fully transparent glass! Maybe you want the room to look bigger? But it's really inconvenient. Imagine going to the toilet without a cover... Weird! 4. The humidifier in the room makes a lot of noise when it is turned on. I can't sleep, so I have to turn it off. So it's hard work every morning. 5. The sound insulation is average, and those who have poor sleep should choose carefully."}]},"ServerData":null}
