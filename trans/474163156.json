The location is good. There is an airport line and a subway ring line nearby. The transportation is convenient. Now the fast Ibis has been changed to light luxury + intelligent, and there are robots delivering food, which is very good. The sanitation is up to standard, there is free water and drinks in the room every day, and there is a free supper at ten o'clock in the evening. In addition to the front desk, the lobby also has a dining area, bar, and billiards. The only thing I need to complain about is that the internet speed is too slow, and the WiFi signal is also poor, always disconnected."}]},"ServerData":null}
