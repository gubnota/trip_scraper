The dual subways of Line 6 and Line 8 are just around the corner. Beihai Park and Prince Gong's Mansion are within walking distance. It's perfect! The service attitude is also very good, patient and kind. The bed is relatively large, and the written 1.8 meters feels more than 1.8 meters. Although the room is not big, the layout is reasonable and easy to use. The bathroom is translucent, which may be inconvenient for some families. The curtains are fully automatic, and the bathroom lights are automatically sensed! In short, 5 points are recommended!"}]},"ServerData":null}
