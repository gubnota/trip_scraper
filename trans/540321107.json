It is the most cost-effective hotel in Sanyuanqiao since its opening!\n\nðŸš— Transportation: It takes only 2 minutes to walk to Sanyuanqiao Subway Station + Airport Express Station. It is also super convenient to take a taxi to the airport - go directly to the Airport Expressway.\n\nðŸ§¹Hygiene: The room is not big, so the hygiene is in place. Hope to keep it up. There are washing machines and dryers downstairs, so you donâ€™t need to spend a lot of money on business trips\n\nðŸ””Service: Breakfast until 12 o'clock. In a word - help! Great for young people. All drinks from the minibar are free!\n\nThe only thing that needs to be improved is the English translation (pictured ðŸ™‚)"}]},"ServerData":null}
