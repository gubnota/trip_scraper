I usually choose hotels above 4 stars. It is really wise to choose this citygo this time. 1. It is convenient, close to the subway and pedestrian street, super convenient; the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and Beijing are on the list We basically ate a few snacks on foot. 2. We chose a duplex and a deluxe double bed. The duplex is really good and cost-effective. Even a single bed can sleep two people, but the luxury is too small , It’s basically useless to have a balcony, and it’s not recommended to spend more money. The price is almost the same. You can choose two duplexes to be more comfortable; 3. The service is also very good, and they are all young people. It is suitable for traveling without driving. Recommended"}]},"ServerData":null}
