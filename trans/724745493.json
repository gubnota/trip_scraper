The room service did not help to change them. This is a bit unhappy. The TV in the room, the white light and red light of the socket power supply need to be covered with pillows, otherwise I really can't stand the stimulation, I hope the store can handle it properly. The room is small, and the smart lighting in the bathroom is quite considerate. The temperature of the bath water is constant, and the use of large and small showers together does not affect the water flow, which is quite satisfactory. The overall feeling is ok. Will choose again next time."}]},"ServerData":null}
