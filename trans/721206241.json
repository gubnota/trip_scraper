It is an independent building with the Sanyuanqiao subway station behind it. Unfortunately, when I went there, it had to be repaired until March, so I couldn't take the subway.\nPeople with poor sleep quality should avoid lightning. Although the room is smart, there are red spots on the sockets, which need to be blocked with pillows. The sound insulation is not good. I don't know if there is a sound that is not suitable for children twice from the next door or the opposite side. I can barely fall asleep until after 1 o'clock.\nPeople who like to open windows for ventilation can't stand the fact that the windows can only be opened about 2 cm from the side."}]},"ServerData":null}
