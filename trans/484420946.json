This is the airport express station to the Capital Airport. If you go to Daxing Airport, it will be far away. The nearby area is not a scenic spot, but an office building area, so the choice of meals is more work meals. The subway station deducts lunch on the first floor of the shopping mall. Time for many people. The hotel room is very small, there is a free supper in the hotel lobby at night, and there is also a self-service washing machine, recommended for business and travel friends"}]},"ServerData":null}
