I am in the room next to the elevator, and I have never heard the sound of the elevator. . There are also two 711s nearby, as well as Starbucks. It’s really convenient. It’s three stations to the Sanlitun subway hahahaha\nThe bed is comfortable, and the bathroom equipment is all from krohe, which is very easy to use\ncome next time"}]},"ServerData":null}
