The decoration style is really strong nightclub style, but to be honest it is quite western, haha. . . The rooms are small, well laid out and the bathrobes provided are interesting. Special praise for the breakfast of the same hotel, it is really good, and it is recommended for business travel if you are looking for convenient transportation"}]},"ServerData":null}
