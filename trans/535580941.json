The comfort of the pillow is the type I like very much: it has enough support, but not too hard, and the down material feels strong. It's just the right choice to lie on the bed and watch TV at night.\nThere are billiards, table football, bar, leisure area, restaurant and other settings in the lobby. The area is not small and the functions are complete. There is a small free gym at the end of the lobby. There are not many equipments, but they also meet certain needs.\nYou donâ€™t have to go downstairs to pick up the food after ordering it, there will be a robot to deliver it"}]},"ServerData":null}
