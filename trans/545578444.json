After choosing for a long time, I chose this duplex room. I didn't expect too much at first, but I chose this one because it is not far away from various places, and it takes one line to go to Universal, and my wife is really satisfied with it! ! !\nFirst of all, the geographical conditions are very good. The entrance is Zhushikou Station of Line 7, and the downstairs is the Lawson Convenience Store. It is not close to Tiananmen Square, and there is a small bar nearby, which is super good! ! The wine is delicious and comfortable! Right behind the hotel!\nThen the duplex room is really beyond my expectation. The two bathrooms are fully equipped, so you donâ€™t have to fight with your girlfriends to use them hahahaha\nThe service is also very good, the waiters on the first floor feel like they are guarded 24 hours a day.\nAll in all, this is really a hotel I had a very happy stay in Beijing ~ I will definitely choose this hotel again"}]},"ServerData":null}
