I feel at ease hahahahahaha I didn't pay attention to the inner window when I booked the room and asked the lady at the front desk to give it to me I was upgraded to a room, but I didn't expect to be upgraded for free! Thank you very much❤️Although the room size is small, this bed type design is very suitable for a girl who lives alone and feels safe! It is also very close to Tiananmen Square and it is very convenient to watch the flag raising. This time I chose this hotel temporarily for transit, and I am very satisfied. I will continue to choose this hotel next time I come to Beijing!"}]},"ServerData":null}
