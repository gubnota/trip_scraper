It takes 3 minutes to walk to Line 10, and you can go directly to the airport. Unfortunately, there is no parking space. If you have friends, it is inconvenient to pick up and drop off. You need to go to the office building next door to park.\nIt's very close to the business district, and it's very convenient to eat and go shopping.\nLet's talk about the hotel. The hotel is very convenient because the robot delivers things, breakfast until 12 o'clock, free supper, lG washing machine and dryer. Let me tell you that the washing machine is very easy to use. I washed a down jacket and a coat, which is very good . There is a conversation table in the lobby, equipped with unlimited chargers and plugs, which is very convenient. There are pool tables and board games in the lobby, as well as automatic snack machines. Very convenient.\nThe rooms are small, but very well designed. But the layout of the bed is unreasonable, and it is not very well maintained. The second is that the mattress is too soft, and those who are not used to sleeping on soft rubber beds must be cautious."}]},"ServerData":null}
