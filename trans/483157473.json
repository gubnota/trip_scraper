I randomly searched for a hotel with high cost performance and good reviews. I was pleasantly surprised when I checked in.\nThe hotel is near the Sanyuanqiao subway station, next to the Phoenix Shopping Center, and there is a commercial street opposite, which is very convenient.\nThe room is relatively small, but it belongs to the type of \"a sparrow is small and complete\". It is very clean. The lights and curtains in the room are all controlled by the bed, which is very convenient. My favorite is the shower room. The shower equipment is very good and the water is very good. Temperature is well regulated. The bedding is also considered comfortable, it is very comfortable to stay for a few days～\nThe hotel's breakfast bill is 69 per person, but you can eat it until 12 noon, which is convenient for those of us who sleep until 11 o'clock on weekends, and can directly treat it as brunch. The most heart-warming thing is that there are free chicken soup wontons every night from 10:00 to 11:00, which is delicious~\nIt’s also very convenient to order food from the hotel. There is a robot delivering it to the door of the room. The elder brother on the opposite side seems to order food several times a day. Sometimes he even talks to the robot, which is very cute~\nIn short, it is a hotel that I want to live in in the future."}]},"ServerData":null}
