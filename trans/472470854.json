The hotel is near the Sanyuanqiao subway exit, with convenient transportation. There are large shopping malls nearby for eating and shopping. When I ordered takeaway, it was convenient for the robot to deliver the food, so I didnâ€™t have to go downstairs to get it myself. The only thing is that the room is a bit small ðŸ˜‚ It seems that the hotel rooms in Beijing at this price are not big."}]},"ServerData":null}
