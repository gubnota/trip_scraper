Ordering food is delivered by a robot upstairs, which is very novel and interesting, and can talk! The room is clean, the facilities are complete, and the degree of automation is high. Most young people will like it very much! There is a subway station near the hotel, so it's very convenient to travel! The hotel has a clean and practical gym, laundry room, billiards, foosball, reading area, and a roof to go to, which is really surprising!"}]},"ServerData":null}
