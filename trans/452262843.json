Later, I communicated with the front desk to redeem the breakfast with Ctrip super member points, which felt very suitable~ No extra bed, the hotel room is a bit small, but the location is good, it takes about 20 minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square! We didn't drive, so we don't know if it's convenient to park nearby. You can ask the front desk of the hotel. The service of the brothers and sisters at the front desk is excellent! The only fly in the ointment is that some hotels are on the first floor, and there will be small flying insects in the room."}]},"ServerData":null}
