It's very convenient to walk to Tiananmen Square for about 20 minutes. A bunch of delicious food on the pedestrian street. The room is relatively small, without windows, it is a bit depressing, the air conditioner is loud, and because it spans two buildings, it is a bit inconvenient to use two elevators to go up and down. You can visit Dashilan and Bada Hutong."}]},"ServerData":null}
