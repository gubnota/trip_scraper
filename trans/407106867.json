You can go to Dashilan, Sanqing Garden and so on after putting down your luggage and going out for a stroll. At that time, I went there to see the national flag being raised, and it only took about 20 minutes to walk there. Moreover, it is very convenient to go to other attractions. I recommended it to my friends when I came back, and I will stay here again when I go to Beijing!"}]},"ServerData":null}
