Fortunately, we two girls live there, otherwise it would be too embarrassing.\nYou can walk to Tiananmen Square, but in fact, you have to walk to the bus station, and the Zhushikou subway station is very close!\nThe service attitude is very good. We asked for an ironing machine at the front desk and gave it to us. We can pick up toothpaste and toothbrush collection bags at the front desk.\nspecial reminder! Pay attention to the exit at Zhushikou! ! The exits in the station are on different floors, so take the stairs and take the elevator up after you spot it! !"}]},"ServerData":null}
