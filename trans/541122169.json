(There was no resistance to drinking tea in the room with other friends the night before) It was unreasonable, there was no flexibility at all, and the service attitude was extremely poor.\n🔔Service: In my long business travel career, the worst experience in all hotels in the world, no worse.\n\n🍃Environment: The room is extremely small, aggrieved, and there are no serious chairs to do. There are no sockets on the table to plug in a computer.
