In conclusion, this hotel is the best value for money. Except for the room at the farthest side, the Wi-Fi signal may not be good. The whole is very good. The whole is very smart. The lighting design of entering the room is very scientific, including the bed by the window. There are chargers on the side, so it’s very detailed and convenient to order takeaway (you have to go downstairs to get the takeout from the New International Trade Hotel) Overall, it’s very good, and it’s a hotel worth staying in again!\n🧹Hygiene: Very clean. My skin is prone to allergies. If the hotel I stayed in before was not clean, I would get rashes, but we are fine in this hotel, which means it is very clean.\n🚗 Transportation: Very convenient, it takes ten minutes to take a taxi to go anywhere, and there is a shopping mall within 3-5 minutes on foot, which is really convenient\n🍃Environment: The lobby feels clean and tidy"}]},"ServerData":null}
