The room is not big, but it has everything. The bed is soft, I like it very much, but my friend complained of back pain when he fell asleep. Loved the robot food delivery service and the laundry room. The location is great, the airport to the hotel is very convenient. There is a big shopping mall within a few minutes of walking, and there are many restaurants in it!"}]},"ServerData":null}
