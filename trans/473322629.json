There are white porridge, freshly cooked noodles, and Beijing's paste! The service is really good, there are some children at the front desk but they are very polite! Really good for us! And the facilities and equipment are also very new! Hygienic and clean! The aunt who cleans the guest room is serious and careful! It will also boil a pot of water, which is really touching! There was a lot of luggage when we checked in, and the front desk helped us carry it upstairs! I am really grateful and touched."}]},"ServerData":null}
