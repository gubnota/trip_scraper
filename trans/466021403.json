It’s just that when I renewed my card on the third day, I asked the front desk to notify me to change the bed sheets and quilt covers. After playing, I found that they hadn’t been changed. I called my aunt to change them, and I waited for a long time. The cleaning is too careless and perfunctory. The breakfast time is quite long, so you can wake up and eat. Hope to improve hygiene."}]},"ServerData":null}
