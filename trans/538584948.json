The location is right on Qianmen Street. It is safe at night. Having the hotel breakfast in the morning gives you the feeling of old Beijing.\nThe hardware facilities of the hotel still need to be strengthened. When we went there, many rooms were being renovated. It felt like the hotel hadn't fully opened yet. The shower was not repaired in time on the first day of our stay. The room is fully sensory. I don’t know if it’s the exhaust fan or the room’s exhaust is very loud. It takes about 15 minutes to stop automatically. I think it’s better to install a switch."}]},"ServerData":null}
