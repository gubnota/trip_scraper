I am the most satisfied night in Beijing. I am particularly satisfied with the big bed in the room. The bathroom is separated from the dry and wet. I ordered this package. It is just inside the Dashilan, and it takes ten minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square. It is not convenient in Beijing. It is not easy to take a taxi. For a few days, I will take a special car. It is recommended to ride a car alone. I am not tired and there are many cars."}]},"ServerData":null}
