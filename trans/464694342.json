It takes 5 minutes to walk to Fenghuanghui, where there are all kinds of delicious food. There is a supermarket on the basement floor, which is very convenient. Next to Fenghuanghui is the Sanyuanqiao subway. It is also super convenient to go to the airport expressway. The overall decoration of the hotel is clean and the breakfast is good. The hotel staff are very good during the daytime shift, and the night shift is a little bit worse. We arrived at the hotel very late at night, and we couldn't figure out what to do with the Beijing local treasure. The girl at the front desk was a little impatient. The two security guards at the door were chatting there, and asked for a long time where the elevator to go upstairs was, and finally heard it. Also, the room is relatively small, maybe the room type we booked is small. It is almost impossible to turn around when you put the suitcase on. The sink is on the countertop in the house, and the suitcase that you wash your face in the morning is full of water. Overall, I like it very much, and I should choose it next time."}]},"ServerData":null}
