We didn't care about it. We didn't expect the room to be so hot that we couldn't sleep, and it would wake us up when we fell asleep. The air conditioner didn't care about the decoration. I had to talk to the front desk twice. The first time I gave a fan, the second time I asked for extra money to change the room. I kept asking me to apply for a card to change the room. I was really speechless. It would be better to have a sister who seems to be in charge of doing the laundry for us. Just change to the first floor of the same room, this sister can find the room, but you can't find it at the front desk."}]},"ServerData":null}
