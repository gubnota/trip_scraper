In the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, there are a lot of food, such as buns, bread, eggs, porridge, milk, soy milk, coffee, fruit, fried rice and stir-fried vegetables. It is very good!\nThe only disadvantage of this hotel: the room is difficult to find, and it is difficult for guests to find their own room when they walk through the corridors. Although there are reminders at the front desk, it is easier for first-time guests to get lost. I hope the hotel will add signposts and other measures;\nTo sum up, the hotel as a whole is still very good, and it is recommended to stay!"}]},"ServerData":null}
