The location is also satisfactory, as soon as you go out, you will see the pedestrian street. Today, I walked slowly to Tiananmen Square to play. There are not many people, and the temperature is suitable. Let’s talk about the hotel. The attitude of the staff is very polite and enthusiastic. If you want a room with an inner window, it’s okay to turn on the air conditioner. If you like fresh air and light, you should choose a superior double room with an outer window. . Because I will stay with my child for a month, I told the front desk to give me a slightly larger room, and I am more satisfied after getting the room. This place is better than Nanluoguxiang Huange because there is a small round table, but there is no one there. But there is no place to dry clothes here, so I bought a folding clothes rack myself. Ctrip points are also exchanged for free breakfast, and the variety is not bad."}]},"ServerData":null}
