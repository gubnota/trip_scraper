It is very easy to find. There are subway stations at the beginning and end of the road, and the bus station is also very convenient. All kinds of sightseeing cars, buses, and tourist buses are not far away, but the location itself is very quiet, quiet in the midst of prosperity.\n\nRoom type: two double beds, two bathrooms, very good. The only fly in the ointment is the fully transparent design of the toilet and bathroom. It is a little awkward to live with the family, so I got rid of the help of the hotel administrator to block it. In addition, there is no dry and wet separation in the toilet, which is easy to flood Jinshan.\n\nService: Very good, warm and ready to help at any time, there seems to be a midnight snack at night. However, the room does not provide tea bags and coffee at all, which is very simple. The bedding is clean and quite refreshing, which is an important reason why I will choose cutigo in the future.\n\nThe hotel is especially suitable for people who come to travel. It is very convenient to go to Tiananmen, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace and even the Great Wall. It is also necessary to remind that this location is close to the core area, and the ID card will be checked five, six, seven or eight times a day. It will be difficult to go to Tiananmen Square by walking, and the mobile phone signal may be affected in the hotel, so you can only rely on wifi."}]},"ServerData":null}
