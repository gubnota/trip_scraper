It is on Qianmen Street, so there are two subway stations: Zhushikou + Qianmen, buses and taxis are also convenient.\n[The sanitation is so-so] Just wipe it down every day, make the bed neatly, and put the level of free drinking water. Sometimes I wonder if I came in to clean it today (the dust may have something to do with the weather in Beijing)"}]},"ServerData":null}
