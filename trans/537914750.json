The service is excellent. The staff at the front desk went to the room in detail to help with TV projection. The only thing is that the network is too slow when the TV is projected. But when the network is turned off, the TV cannot be projected. The maximum volume can only be adjusted to 25! No, the overall feeling is not bad. I would like to make a personal suggestion. It would be better to replace the hotel bathrobe with white. The black makes people feel dirty, and there is still dust on the bathrobe!"}]},"ServerData":null}
