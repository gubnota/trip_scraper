There are very few types of breakfast, there is nothing to eat, and it is not delicious. When I entered the restaurant, there was a waitress at the door who wanted to check the room card. I gave it to her. I guess I didn't find out my breakfast information. I asked the front desk if breakfast was included, and I was stunned to stand there and wait for a long time! I have stayed in many fast hotels, but I have never encountered such a hotel. Is it because I am afraid that I will eat and drink or what?\n2. When eating breakfast, I asked the waiter to help me get a transparent glass to hold the juice. The waitress also told me that their breakfast cups are all opaque glasses. Speechless! Do I need you to specifically say it again? Otherwise, why would I ask you for it.\n3. When leaving the store, I wanted the waiter to provide a mask, but the waitress at the front desk said no, ha ha.\n4. I stayed for three nights, and the sound insulation in the room was pretty poor. I went to sleep after 11:00 p.m., and was woken up by the sound of doors opening and closing in other rooms three or four times in a row. I could hear the outside sounds clearly, which really affected my sleep. !\n5. The room is very small, the washstand is together with the room, and the wash water is scattered all over the floor by accident!\nAdvantages: It is close to the subway station, and it is very convenient to go to Sanyuanqiao subway station.\nWell, I feel like I won't live again in the future!"}]},"ServerData":null}
