The location is not bad, it is close to Zhushikou subway station, at the southernmost end of Qianmen Pedestrian Street, almost next to the south gate. So even though it is called Tiananmen Square, it takes more than 1 kilometer to walk to Tiananmen Square...but take a break from the noise, the Lawson Convenience Store is right next door.\n2. The duplex structure is relatively rare in the hotel. Although the area is small, it can also ensure the comfort of living.\n3. The bathroom is Hansgrohe, which is relatively new, and the water temperature and quantity are fine.\n4. There are two TVs in the bathroom upstairs and downstairs, which is very convenient.\n5. Mineral water is provided in the room, if it is not enough, you can ask for it.\n6. Some small designs are quite good, such as clothes hangers and luggage racks that can be retracted and put away.\n7. The front desk service is very good, and overall it is worth going again.\n\ninsufficient:\n1. The investment in hardware is spent on shower equipment, but it is obvious that the quality of other furniture and hardware is not high. But considering the geographical location and price, it is also cost-effective.\n2. The two sofas upstairs and downstairs are dirty.\n3. The shower room pursues a modern appearance, poor practicality, pure transparency is embarrassing, and there is no shower room door on the second floor. When taking a shower, there is water on the ground in front of the toilet, which is easy to slip.\n4. When sleeping on the second floor at night, the smell of the sewer is quite strong, and there is also a smell of smoke...\n5. One or two of the stair railings near the second floor are loose.\n6. Breakfast is really...a paper bag per person, with a convenience store sandwich, eggs and milk in it..."}]},"ServerData":null}
