It's just beside the front gate, and it's just a short walk to Tiananmen Square. Downstairs is a Lawson, where you can buy everything.\nThe room type I booked is really compact... the sheets are a little stained. The window of my room is a bit drafty, and it is quite cold to sleep at night. This is not satisfactory, and the hotel needs to check and repair it again.\nThe front desk of the hotel also provides a free luggage butler service, which is really super super super convenient. You can send your luggage to the airport, train station or the next hotel, saving time, effort and money!"}]},"ServerData":null}
