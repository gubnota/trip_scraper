I’m dying. I called the guest room center three times and no one answered. Finally, I called a mobile phone and told me that it couldn’t be turned on. The solution is to let me open the window by myself. It’s understandable not to turn on the air conditioner during the epidemic, but why not? Inform customers in advance?
