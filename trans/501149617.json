It is very convenient to go out to Qianmen Street. The hotels under Huazhu are of good quality, but the duplex building on the first floor has staff passing by at night. In addition, gold members gave three good breakfasts. I will choose it again in the future. It is that there is no signal in the room, and the phone cannot be received. I hope to improve."}]},"ServerData":null}
