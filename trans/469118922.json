It takes only 2 minutes to walk to the side of the road and take a bus. It takes 3 minutes to reach Zhushikou Subway Station\nThere are many scenic spots around, and the security at night is super good. People who are not staying in the hotel are not allowed to enter and exit\nThe double bed we stayed in is also quite big. It should be no problem to bring children, but the lighting in the sleeping area is a bit dim, because there is only a small desk lamp and a small light, which may be for better sleep. If you put on makeup, the light will not be enough , There will be a mobile rack next to the bed, although it is useless, and there will be less places to hang clothes in the bathroom, and there will be no heating. When you come out of the bathroom, you will feel super cold. I hope the heating channel can be improved.\nIn addition, the cleaners will clean up for us every day, but they will not touch other things indiscriminately, and they will be in place when they come back. this is good\nThe front desk staff is very enthusiastic, because we southerners are probably worried that we are not used to eating, so we suggest that we eat in the restaurant. Indeed, there are quite a lot of styles in the buffet in the morning, and the taste is not bad. You may see most of them after eating for 4 days, so I feel relatively It's monotonous, hahaha. It's actually pretty well matched.\nOverall not bad."}]},"ServerData":null}
