I have stayed at CitiGo in Suzhou, Shanghai and Sanyuanqiao in Beijing before, and the experience is very good, but the one in Tiananmen Square is really disappointing. The staff at the front desk are still serious and responsible, but the cleaning service is really perfunctory. I didn’t change the quilt cover and bed sheets for three days. I just spread it casually and it’s over. On the last day when I went back, I found that the toilet floor mat Put it with the towels instead of hanging on the bathroom doorknob, really hope the cleaning staff are more responsible. It's okay if the room is smaller, but the sanitation and cleaning must meet the basic standards. I hope it can be taken seriously."}]},"ServerData":null}
