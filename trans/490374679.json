It is located on Qianmen Street, very close to the Zhushikou subway station. The transportation is very convenient. There is a Lawson convenience store downstairs, and there is also 711 nearby. It is also very close to Xianyukou and Dashilan Commercial Street.\nThe room type of the hotel is very good, the facilities in the room are complete, especially the toiletries; the curtains are fully automatic, the blackout is great, and the bed is very comfortable.\nThis is the second time I have stayed here, but this time the WiFi in the room is not very stable, Apple phones and tablets are often disconnected, I hope the hotel can solve this problem.\nNext time I come to Beijing, I will choose this hotel again."}]},"ServerData":null}
