This trip to Beijing is considered the most comfortable hotel. I will stay there again if I have a chance. The facilities and equipment are quite satisfactory, the location is great, the rooms are not small, and the price/performance ratio is very high. It's just that there is no service at the front desk, no greetings and no smiles. I don't know if it is a unique feature of the store. Ctrip points are upgraded to check out at 2 o'clock. One went downstairs and was trapped. If there is a problem, call the front desk and hang up in an extremely impatient tone. Other than this it's pretty good."}]},"ServerData":null}
