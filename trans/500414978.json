The hotel has very convenient transportation. It is located on the pedestrian street of Qianmen Street. It is very convenient to take my children to watch the national flag raising, to visit Tiananmen Square, and to the hutongs of old Beijing. They are all snacks. The young lady at the front desk is very kind and enthusiastic. We called before we came. The young lady at the front desk went out to greet me. When I entered the lobby, I could smell a very familiar smell. I felt like coming home. The buffet in the morning was also very good value. Sit in the lobby and drink coffee☕️While admiring the pedestrians passing by on the pedestrian street, experience the feeling of old Beijing. Fashion and tradition blend together, very comfortable, Huange's bedding is comfortable, clean and hygienic, I really like the shower head that can change the water flow, I love it. In the evening, my daughter invited a little sister from a relative who lived nearby to play on the pedestrian street. When I was tired, I could rest in the lobby of the hotel. It was very comfortable!"}]},"ServerData":null}
