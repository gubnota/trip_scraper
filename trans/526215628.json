It was agreed to delay check-out from one to two o'clock, and then I fell asleep, and a call at four o'clock asked me if I would continue to stay. . I was really touched and brought trouble to the hotel. I am also a hotel owner and I know it will take time to clean these after check-out. The environment is also good.\nAlthough it was indeed a bit hot at the time because the air-conditioning line was broken, it was quickly resolved later."}]},"ServerData":null}
