The subway station is very close. There is Line 7.8 at Zhushikou on the other side of the street, and Qianmen Station on Line 2 on the other side of the street. There are also many bus lines, and there is a special line for traveling to the Great Wall and a special line for night tours on Chang'an Street. The most important thing is that the nucleic acid point is very close! It is really a veritable \"tourist street\"! For tourists, it is really worry-free.\nOf course, many people said, why live in this kind of \"tourist street\", the locals would not go there. But, we are tourists, hahaha. Why do we go to places where the locals gather? Beijing is so big and we only have a few days. Is it all spent looking for ways, food, and places to live? What a waste of trouble, spend more money and save trouble!\nThe interior of the hotel room is very ordinary, too small, so small that two people can't turn around. But here every inch of land is very expensive, understandable ha!\nThe service of the hotel is very good, everyone is very friendly."}]},"ServerData":null}
