It took a long time to wait for us to check in, half of which said that we would provide a screenshot of the health treasure. After finishing the screenshot, the person went to another window to handle business, and his ID card was held there again. I waited for more than ten or twenty minutes before coming back, but when I came back, I said that I had to provide other screenshots. I didnâ€™t finish talking at the beginning, and I just waited to waste time. The service at the front desk is extremely poor. I have never tried to book a room in advance and leave people there for more than half an hour after checking in. A few people are running around in a mess while doing something there, which is extremely inefficient.\nThe location is very remote, 40 minutes by taxi to most attractions in Beijing, 10 subway stations are inconvenient, but it is possible to go to the airport. The room is relatively small, but the facilities are perfect."}]},"ServerData":null}
