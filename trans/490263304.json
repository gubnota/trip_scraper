The front desk service is very considerate. What I am very dissatisfied with is that the bathroom hygiene is not thorough, the hair in the bathroom is not removed, the sink is not wiped, and the watermark on the comb is what it looks like when you go out in the morning and come back in the evening. I have lived in citigos in several cities, the sanitation of this place needs to be improved!"}]},"ServerData":null}
