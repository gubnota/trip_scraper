The front desk told me that the room hadn’t been cleaned and asked me to wait. I didn’t apologize at all. At my strong request, the person in charge immediately opened a room for me, but still didn’t say a word of apology. . Obviously there are vacancies, but they are unwilling to coordinate with me. They have a bad attitude and are not polite. When I checked out, I thanked the front desk, but they ignored me. This kind of service concept is seriously inconsistent with the listed four-star. There is no parking space in front of the door, so it is inconvenient to pick up and drop off guests. The room is very narrow, and the room service lady is very nice."}]},"ServerData":null}
