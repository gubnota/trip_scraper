The service is also very good! There are convenience stores and shopping malls next to it, which is also very convenient. Downstairs in the shopping mall is the subway and the airport line. It is very close to Beijing South Railway Station and the airport. The hotel is a very intelligent hotel, with robots delivering food. The free breakfast buffet is delicious and very humane until twelve o'clock at noon Not at all. At 10 o'clock in the evening, there is wonton for supper, which is also delicious. I ate two bowls haha~ The room is a little small, but it is very comfortable for two people to live in. It is just right and very clean! Play billiards in the downstairs hall, and you can also work and read books, which is very comfortable. It is very convenient to go anywhere~~~ It is really highly recommended! ðŸ¤©"}]},"ServerData":null}
