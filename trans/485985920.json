It is located at the southern end of Qianmen Pedestrian Street. It takes only one minute to walk to the subway. There is a Lawson convenience store downstairs. If you have nothing to do, you can go downstairs and go shopping at Dashilan Pedestrian Street. It is also very close to Tiananmen Square. It is recommended to call online appointments It's very tiring to go around Tiananmen by car, and the subway is very tiring. The service attitude of the front desk and the hotel are good. After exaggerating, I have to talk about the shortcomings. The hotel seems to have opened relatively early. The facilities in the house are not too new. The air conditioner can’t cool down. I don’t know what to do in summer when I’m fine in winter. The disinfection in the room needs to be improved, but there’s no dust or smell. , Mattress is relatively clean. All in all, it's ok at this price point. keep going"}]},"ServerData":null}
