They arrived at 8:30 in the morning and told us that we could not check in. After waiting for a long time, we asked again and said no. The reason was that we arrived too early and we could only do it after 12 o'clock. The tone seemed to be ours It’s the same mistake as the previous one. They asked us to go to the door to find someone to store our luggage, but we didn’t say who it was and didn’t arrange for that person. Fortunately, there was a young and capable young man in the team who helped us to scan the health treasure. There was a problem with the software, and it took a long time to fix it. I can't get out, the little girl at the front desk is very indifferent, and she doesn't help to look around, saying that as long as there is no one, it will not work, everyone must be there to be able to stay. We are here to play, not to see your faces, it really affects the mood. Except for the front desk, other hardware configurations are good."}]},"ServerData":null}
