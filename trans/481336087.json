Black technology is everywhere, smart home robots and the like. German GROHE water fixtures and Duravit sanitary ware are also included. The key is breakfast until 12 o'clock and a 24-hour laundry room and gym. If it weren't for the slightly smaller rooms, other hotels really wouldn't be able to survive. In short, it is amazing, and it will be the first choice for future travel in Beijing."}]},"ServerData":null}
