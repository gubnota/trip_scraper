The manager of the hotel is extremely corrupt. He despises the customers who place orders from third-party platforms with preferential treatment. He threatened the guests to check out voluntarily, but failed, and openly used the despicable method of turning off the hot water and heating. I don't know how Huazhu Hotel let such an adulterer become a hotel, he is simply the vice of Huazhu Group. I hope that the group will strictly investigate and deal with such black sheep, and let such a person be the store manager. I really donâ€™t know how much the senior management of Huazhu Hotel has benefited from this store manager. They can condone such arrogance in the position of store manager without any professional ethics."}]},"ServerData":null}
