        "content": "Facilities: Overall, it's okay. The room facilities are relatively new. There aren't many things around. There is a convenience store next to it that can satisfy daily shopping.\n\nEnvironment: Because it is newly opened, the internal environment of the hotel is quite clean.\n\nService: The hotel service seemed confusing at times. The first time I requested a ride to the subway station, I was told it would arrive at 8 o'clock. The second time I made a reservation, it was told it would take 10 o'clock and the ride would go to Universal Studios.\nWe only went to Universal Studios once a day, at 8:30, so early in the day Universal Studios wasnâ€™t even open yet, so we had to take a taxi.\nI hope the hotel lobby can better arrange car time reasonably.\n\nHygiene: During one cleaning session, I specifically told the cleaning aunt not to tidy the bed. Just replace the garbage and disposable items. When I came back, the bed was tidied because there were a lot of documents and items on the bed, and they were all sorted. I hope you can pay attention to this.\n\nOverall the hotel is very good, suitable for tourists going to Universal Studios. It is only 3-5 minutes by taxi from the subway station. You can choose this hotel when traveling to Beijing in the future."
