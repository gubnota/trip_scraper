The water is very large and the bath is very comfortable. Full-length mirrors and bathroom mirrors are great for taking photos. I ordered breakfast, which includes porridge, noodles, wontons, steamed dumplings, etc. There are quite a lot of varieties, very Chinese style. If you are full in the morning, you can go out and play until the afternoon. The only drawback is that although it is shown to be about 1.6 kilometers away from the subway station, it is very troublesome to walk. The road is very dark and I dare not walk at night. I have to take a taxi when I come back. There are two other things, which are not considered shortcomings, but I would like to make some comments here. First, when I checked in, the clerk told me that I didn't have breakfast. Later, I contacted Ctrip's customer service. They contacted me and told me that it was a backend failure. I think both Ctrip and Hanting are relatively mature systems. Then I checked out on the 26th. When cleaning on the 25th, my aunt didn't give me mineral water, towels, or slippers. I felt like I could have come and left feeling at home, but it felt a little weird to have something suddenly reduced on the 25th. When I came back on the night of the 25th and left on the 26th, I actually didn’t have enough water to drink. It felt like I was about to leave and just started to deal with it casually.",

The hotel is a bit far from the subway station, but we told the front desk that they would immediately arrange a car to pick us up from the subway station. We would like to express special praise to the driver who left the hotel. The car took us to the subway entrance and took our suitcases to the subway stairs. The hotel is surrounded by a residential area, which is very quiet. There are no restaurants or other businesses, but the nearby takeout is delicious and affordable. The hotel has a robot that delivers takeout to the room, and the children like it very much. The only problem is the breakfast. When I placed the order, it showed one breakfast per day, and children had free breakfast. I thought there was breakfast for adults and children every day, but I was told that there was only one person per head. Overall, the hotel is very cost-effective and is recommended.",
