        "content": "The room during this trip exceeded my expectations and I am very satisfied:\n1. Newly renovated, the rooms are very new, very clean, and soundproofed\n2. I am very satisfied with the breakfast buffet. There are many varieties and the taste is very good. I got up early to try it and I am satisfied with it.\n3. There is a dedicated laundry room that integrates washing and drying, and can also be ironed, which is satisfactory\n4. Due to travel issues, check-out was delayed. The boss was very nice and delayed the check-out by 2 points.\n\nAll in all, it's very good. Friends who need it can book a stay."
