        "content": "The service of the hotel staff is very good. They are very polite and will greet you as soon as you enter the lobby. It is very convenient to have free parking at the door. There are security guards patrolling the building at night, which is very reassuring. The lady in the guest room is also very enthusiastic. She saw my pile of dirty clothes. It was still very hot after a day, so I put it in the washing machine and washed and dried it. The fried eggs for breakfast are very nutritious, and the millet porridge is very fragrant, thick and delicious. The breakfast staples include pancakes, steamed buns and various whole grains, which are very fresh and nutritious. My favorite fruit is watermelon. It was very comfortable to sleep in the room. I really want to buy the same type of pillow. The height is very suitable and it is very comfortable for people with cervical spondylosis. The room is well soundproofed and I can fall asleep quickly. ! ! The overall feeling is very good and the price/performance ratio is very high. Will book again in the future"
