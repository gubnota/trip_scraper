        "content": "The hotel facilities are relatively new, the environment is okay, it is clean and hygienic, and the front desk service is also very good. I am quite satisfied. Two points to complain about: First, the breakfast. During the Spring Festival, I had to dine in, but the breakfast was really average, as shown in the picture, it was the same for four consecutive days; second, the room TV was a chargeable item, and there was basically no other option except live TV. Can't see."
