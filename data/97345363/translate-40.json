        "content": "The newly opened Hanting Hotel has a smart device in the room, which allows you to open and close the curtains without getting up. The breakfast provided by the hotel is very delicious. The fried dough sticks fried by the elder sister are especially crispy and delicious. The millet porridge is also very sweet with red dates! I will stay here again when I come to Beijing in the future. The overall feeling is very satisfactory!"
