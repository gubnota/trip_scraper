        "content": "The room faces south, the facilities are relatively new, the bed is comfortable for sleeping, and it is quieter as it is not facing the street. There are 2⃣️ small parks not far away, where you can take a leisurely walk and refresh yourself. There is the High School Affiliated to Tsinghua University next to it. You can buy daily necessities in the supermarket downstairs. There is also a snack shop where you can grab a bite if you are hungry.\nThe hotel has a very smart little robot, which is very cute. It is very convenient to get takeout and express delivery without leaving the house. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the hair dryer is of good quality. It is a great experience to stay here."
