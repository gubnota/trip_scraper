The wet and dry shower in the bathroom also produces water very quickly, the water temperature is very suitable, the wireless network in the room is very fast, and the front desk staff is also very professional and enthusiastic. There is a robot that delivers food. When we got cold outside during the day, the hotel thoughtfully cooked ginger soup for us at night, which was very good!"
