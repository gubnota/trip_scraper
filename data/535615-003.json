I haven't tried that Sichuan restaurant before. I don't know. The hotel still has freshly ground coffee every day. Because the hotel room is relatively small, no extra bed can be added. This hotel room is rebuilt from an old office building, so the layout is not like a standard hotel. The bathroom and the room are in the same room. When taking a shower, they are separated by a relatively transparent curtain. Not suitable for colleagues or friends, but for couples. We did not book breakfast at the hotel, so I can’t comment. His parking lot is also relatively small, because the hotel is located in the city center, subway, bus are more convenient. The service of the hotel, because we have no special service requirements, so the service quality of the waiter is still quite satisfactory. Our room is on the fourth floor of the hotel. From the window, you can see the Bell and Drum Tower. It can be considered a city view room.","translatedLanguage":"en","translatedSource":"G","travelType":70,"travelTypeText":"Couples","rating":4,"ratingInfo":{"ratingAll":4,"ratingLocation":4,"ratingFacility":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoom":4,"commentLevel":"Good"},"recommend":true,"imageList":[],"imageCuttingsList":[],"videoList":[],"feedbackList":[{"type":3,"createDate":"2020-09-21 18:53:48","content":"尊敬的賓客，您好！感謝您入住南鑼CitiGO酒店，很高興陪您走過旅途中的一段美好時光，本店位於南鑼鼓巷南口地理位置非常優越，近日雨水較多，請您注意出行安全，您的旅途由我們呵護，天黑有燈??，下雨有傘??，為您打造愉悅順暢的入住體驗是我們CitiCO始終如一的追求，期待重逢，再續美好！","imageCuttingsList":[],"translatedContent":"Dear guest, hello!
