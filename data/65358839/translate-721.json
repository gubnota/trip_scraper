        "content": "This all-season hotel is newly renovated and has a good location, next to the parking lot. The room is clean and comfortable, with reasonable layout and large space for activities. What is very interesting is that with the application of smart home, you can use voice control to turn on and off the lights, which is very convenient. Although it faces the street, it is not noisy at night. The service staff are kind and polite, and the cleaning is very serious. I am very satisfied with my stay."
