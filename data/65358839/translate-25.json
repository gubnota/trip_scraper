        "content": "I came to write a good review for \"Guest Room Sister Wei\". Auntie really took good care of me. Her service attitude was super good. She never lacked water. She tidied my room cleanly and meticulously every day. Every time the takeout arrives, it will be delivered within five minutes, which is a bonus for lazy people. There is a girl wearing glasses at the front desk, and every time I open the door and see her smiling and bringing delicious food, I feel very good. If you plan to go to Beijing Zoo for a short distance, you can consider this place. The bus is very close and very convenient."
