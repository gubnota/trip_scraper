        "content": "This is the second hotel we have stayed in in Beijing, and I have to say that this hotel is very cost-effective. There is a bus right in front of the hotel, which goes directly to Tsinghua University, Peking University, National People's Congress, Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace. It is also convenient to transfer to the subway. The room we stayed in was a double room. The bed was very big and the children slept comfortably."
