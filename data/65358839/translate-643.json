        "content": "A great stay experience! The location is easy to find, right on the roadside. The most important thing is that the service is excellent. The ID card they gave me when I checked in was put in a protective cover. Because I was carrying a big box, they even sent me upstairs. Then there are tea sets and two different kinds of tea in the room~very good! Takeaways will be delivered to your door by robots, which is safe and convenient. Before leaving, I was given a box of tea, which was a surprise~\nClean, hygienic and considerate ~ good reviews"
