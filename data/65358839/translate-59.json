        "content": "The room was very nice and well-equipped with facilities. The front desk service was very attentive. They printed documents for me and delivered takeaways by courier. It's just that the soundproofing of the room is not very good, and the corridor is a bit noisy in the morning. Maybe the children are traveling during the summer vacation, and the cleaning lady is pushing the car and knocking on the door. Xiao Li at the front desk gave me some fruit, thank you very much!"
