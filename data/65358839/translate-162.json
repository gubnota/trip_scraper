        "content": "Cleanliness: The cleaning is very clean. Aunt Yan who cleans the second floor is very enthusiastic and very impressed. She helps a lot. Once the things are used up, they will be replenished quickly.\nFront desk: The staff was very enthusiastic and helped with printing a lot of things. If you need anything, call the front desk and the front desk staff will ask the robot to bring it to you.\nEnvironment: The bedroom is very clean, the bed is very comfortable, equipped with Fujian tea and a small refrigerator.\nHowever, I would like to make a small comment. The sound insulation effect in the bedroom is not good. The sound from the corridor sometimes reaches the bedroom and wakes me up in the morning.\nThere is no cafeteria now. The staff brings the meals in the morning. Although it is much more convenient, the breakfast does need to be improved. Many of them can be seen as fast food and lack variety.\nOverall, I'm quite satisfied, it's a small ceiling for an express hotel."
