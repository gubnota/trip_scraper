        "translatedContent": "Stayed here for 7 days. It's very quiet and clean. The cleaning ladies always smile and say hello to us every time we meet. It's a very comfortable interpersonal relationship! Breakfast is also very good, clean, hygienic and delicious. The environment is also very good. I would like to praise a few friends at the front desk, a taller and fatter boy, a shorter boy with glasses, and a girl about the same height as her, Xiao Yuan Tongxiao! On the first day we came here, we asked a lot of small questions because of room changes and breakfast issues. These guys were very patient, very detailed, and explained over and over again. Later, because of invoice issues and luggage storage, we had to upgrade the room type. I have communicated with them several times about the problem, and every time they are warm, polite, thoughtful, meticulous and courteous, which makes several of our colleagues admire us! Professional quality and professional skills go hand in hand! I heard that they are all born around 2000, and I admire them very much! Learn from you! I hope the store manager will praise them, they are really good! There is also a girl who has few interactions but is also very polite and serious! In short, I am not asking for help. Because of these friends, I will definitely come here next time I go on a business trip! Come on! You guys have a bright future!",

Xiao Li, the service guy at the front desk, is enthusiastic and thoughtful, helping to verify orders, taking the initiative to make room cards (if he forgets to bring his room card, he makes one, and he takes the trouble to make several), and he also enthusiastically helps to microwave the guests’ meals in the restaurant. , give him 5 points of praise\n2. The service of the small robot delivering to the room is very good\n3. There is free freshly ground coffee in the hotel lobby, which is very welcoming.\n4. The hotel provides 8 bottles of water every day, which is quite user-friendly in Beijing during the summer.\n5. Recommend the superior twin room, the two 1.5m large beds are very comfortable\n6. The breakfast is cleaner than expected, and the breakfast noodles are especially recommended. It would be better if there was bread and butter\n7. The tea set and tea bags provided in the room are delicious. After a long day of playing, it is very relaxing to drink for a while.\n\nWhen you upgrade to the Huazhu Club, you will get a free breakfast. We found out later that Xiao Li at the front desk enthusiastically reissued the application and refunded the extra breakfast fees paid several times before. Thank you!\n\nAlso in need of improvement are:\n1. The public corridor in the room is relatively old, the carpet is a bit dark, and the ventilation generally has a smell.\n2. There was a lot of dust on the clothes hangers when I checked in.\n3. The handle of the sink switch will fall off\n4. The hair dryer has poor contact and blows air intermittently.\n5. The smart toilet is too sensitive and flushes automatically before it is finished (it is unhygienic to sit on it while flushing)",
