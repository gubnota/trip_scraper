The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and tastes very good. When ordering takeout, a small robot will help deliver it. Before I left, I wanted to weigh my suitcase, so the sister at the front desk brought me a scale from her dormitory. Thank you very much.\nAll in all, it was a great experience and I will stay here again next time I have the chance!\n\nfully equipped\nHygiene: clean and tidy\nService: great"
