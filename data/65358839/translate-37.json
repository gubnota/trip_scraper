        "content": "The hotel is clean and hygienic, and the facilities and equipment are also great. When ordering takeout, a robot will deliver it upstairs. It's very smart and you don't have to go to the front desk. There is also a self-service robot when checking in. The facilities in the room are also great. The TV is super large and can be projected onto the screen. It is very comfortable to watch. The hotel staff are very welcoming and responsible. The location is convenient, close to the subway, and the price/performance ratio is very good."
