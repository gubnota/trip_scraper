        "content": "I booked an hourly room for the college entrance examination. The room is not big, but it is very comfortable and relatively new. The bed and bedding are very comfortable. There is even a latex pillow. This is so comfortable. The toilet is automatic. The only drawback is that there is only one chair and then the bed. If there are two people, one person must go to bed and stay there. Also, as soon as the children went to bed, they would record phone calls and ask if they wanted to check out. Seriously disturbed rest. However it is still recommended. Parking is very inconvenient. There are several parking spaces designed, but it is a dead end and it is difficult to turn around. Might as well not have a parking space."
