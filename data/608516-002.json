It has everything that I wanted in a hotel and they really delivered on that.\n\nThere are plenty of conveniences that make your stay enjoyable. The staff, from the people in the check in desk to the cleaning ladies, is very helpful, accommodating and friendly. \n\nThe laundry room has both washing machines and driers and you don't have to purchase detergent nor liquid softener as they have it readily available for free. I noticed that there is a staff member on site to ensure all stays tidy and properly functioning. \n\nThe gym equipment was just what I needed. They have a good set of dumbbells, some treadmills, and some other machines to get you a good enough workout. \n\nAnother great feature is the extended breakfast hours. Not sure if this is standard in larger cities, but breakfast was served from 7 to 12, which is extremely advantageous. \n\nThe hotel enjoys a favorable location; there is a shopping mall with plenty of restaurants, mostly in the basement floor, and it's within a 2 minute walk. Sanyuanqiao metro station happens to be right next to that same shopping mall, making it very practical to have dinner and take the metro right after.\n\nThe only issue I found was connecting to the internet; you need t enter phone number, wait for the text message with a code and then enter the passport number. I made several attempts to connect to no avail. When I brought it up at the fron desk, one of the girls came to my room and set it up in no time. Unfortunately, I stopped having access after 2 days.\n\nAnyways, definitely staying in this hotel next time I'm in Beijing!!","language":"en","source":1,"travelType":50,"travelTypeText":"Solo travelers","rating":4.7,"ratingInfo":{"ratingAll":4.7,"ratingLocation":5,"ratingFacility":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoom":5,"commentLevel":"Wonderful"},"recommend":true,"imageList":[],"imageCuttingsList":[],"videoList":[],"feedbackList":[{"type":3,"createDate":"2021-08-24 10:08:38","content":"Thank you for your trust and love of citigo.

We found the hotel on Trip.com. Although the room is small it is perfect for a couple. The staff were friendly on arrival and are able to speak some English but with a translation APP it is more than enough to communicate. We were also give cute Christmas boxes with an apple inside, which was a nice touch.\nThe bed is super comfortable and the set up of the room is very space effective. The one concern we had was that the towels smelt like second hand smoke which was not great.\nThere is a nice gym on the first floor, along with 3 washing machines and 3 dryers next to elevators on the right hand side. There is laundry detergent and fabric softener next to the machines and they are available for guests to use 24/7. \nThe location of the hotel is incredible. The line 10 subway station is a 3 minute walk away and downtown is 5 stops from the station on the same line. There is also a lovely Mall one stop away the Mall is The Grand Summit and has other tasty restaurants to enjoy. The Galleria Mall is a 3 minute walk from the hotel which has a nice supermarket and some decent restaurants. There is a Starbucks opposite the Hotel, it is a bit hidden as you need to cross the road and go down a few stairs.
