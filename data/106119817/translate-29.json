        "content": "It's super great. I booked it in advance when taking my children to take their postgraduate entrance exams. The room is clean and comfortable, especially the service is in place, including the young girl and boy at the front desk. They have a strong sense of responsibility, are enthusiastic and thoughtful, and think more carefully about many things than the guests. Even the breakfast and the waiters who clean the room are warm. I have decided that when I go out from now on, I will stay in Orange!"
