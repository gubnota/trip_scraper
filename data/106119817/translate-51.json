        "content": "1. In terms of service: I stayed here for three days. Both the front desk and the manager had very good service. They helped store wheelchairs, and there were elderly people there, and they also helped upgrade the room type.\n\n2. Hygiene: The hotel is newly opened, all facilities are very new, and the fully intelligent toilet is also very easy to use. For children's shoes with higher hygiene requirements, you can choose with confidence!\n\n3. Location and environment: The hotel is next to the University of International Business and Economics. It is the flower season and the environment is beautiful. It is also next to Yuandadu Park. The location is excellent and there are many delicious food nearby~\n\nAnyway! ! ! ! Originally I only wanted to stay for one night, but because it was so comfortable, I stayed for three nights in a row and would go again if I have the chance! ! !\n\ncorrect! There‚Äôs also üçäfree food at the door! ! ! Don‚Äôt worry about vitamin deficiency, hahahahahaha"
