        "content": "Traveling with friends, we stayed at the Orange Hotel next to the Foreign Economic and Trade Center on a rainy dayüè® The water in the shower room was very hot and it was very comfortable after washing. When leaving the store, the front desk clerk also gave me a thoughtful gift bag of snacks and a bottle of mineral water, which was very considerate. Thanks! The food is delivered by a robot, so you don't have to go downstairs to pick up the food yourself, which is super convenient."
