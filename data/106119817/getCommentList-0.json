It was relieved by taking loratadine. A 20 square meter room would be better. It is 1 km away from the subway station. To go to the Forbidden City, Beihai, Summer Palace and other attractions, you need to transfer to the subway. There is no direct line. Popular restaurants such as Xiaodiaoli Soup and Nanmen Shabu Shabu? You need to take a taxi to get to Four Seasons Minfu, etc., which is very inconvenient. The hygiene of the restaurant downstairs is worrisome. The only service staff is the noodle cook for breakfast.",
