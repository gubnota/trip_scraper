        "content": "Overall, it's okay. The location is convenient for travel. There are several buses nearby. I just had to wait for a while when checking in. The lowest price is for a room diagonally opposite the elevator. The noise is a bit loud at night next to the road. I woke up a few times and had a messy dream. There was always a faint smell of disinfectant in the room. I wonder if my sense of smell is too sensitive. The room was small, but fully equipped and clean. I am very satisfied with the clean and tidy facilities. Just call me Xiaodu for the smart facilities. The toilet is also smart. I am very satisfied with this. I encountered a robot several times in the elevator going up and downstairs. There is a coffee machine on the first floor of the Orange Hotel. You can have a cup if you are not in a hurry. It's very good to drink coffee. There are several restaurants nearby which are very convenient for dining."
