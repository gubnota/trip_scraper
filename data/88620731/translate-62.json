For this reason, Duoduo immediately held an emergency meeting, retrained all employees, and implemented corresponding measures for the responsible persons. Punishment; hygiene issues have always been the red line of small shops, and we attach great importance to this. In the future work, we will also strengthen supervision and inspection work again to prevent such problems from happening again. Please give small shops another chance. You will definitely feel the real quality of Hanting; we look forward to your visit again and wish you a happy life!"
