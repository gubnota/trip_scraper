We usually have more guests on business trips and have a relatively quiet schedule. Occasionally there are naughty masters who are in a high mood. If it disturbs you, Rest, feel free to contact Little Hanma, our patrolling security messenger will definitely go to appease the naughty master. In addition, our front desk also has sponge earplugs and steam eye masks, which are available for free. We hope that the care for you is not only in the store, I hope your entire journey will be comfortable and smooth."
