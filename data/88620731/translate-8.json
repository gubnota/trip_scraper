It is very close to the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and opposite the University of International Business and Economics. It is very convenient and quiet to stay here with my family for medical treatment. The front desk is super patient. The hotel is great and the service attitude is very good. Super cost-effective, highly recommended!"

Thank you for the fate that allows us to get to know you. I am honored not to have you. To disappoint you, late winter is approaching and the weather is getting colder. The store has added a self-service laundry room and a high-temperature sterilization dryer to add warmth and convenience to your journey."
