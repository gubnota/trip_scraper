        "content": "The hotel room was very clean, and the most important thing was that it did not have any peculiar smell. I originally only booked it for one night, but because the situation was very good in all aspects, I extended my stay for one more night, from May 9 to May 11, 2023. The service was very good and we were upgraded to a larger room for free. Definitely recommend staying here, you won't be disappointed."
