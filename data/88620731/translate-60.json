        "content": "The bedding and pillows are better and more comfortable than the all-season zero-pressure room in Huazhong. The hotel is in a good location. It's very close to the subway station. It's not far from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. It's close to the key hotel. It also has a parking lot. You can save on parking fees. Many hotels are equipped with food delivery robots, which is great news for lazy cancer patients. Very good living experience. The two guys at the front desk have very good service attitude. Thumbs up."
