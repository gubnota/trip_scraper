        "content": "The room is clean and tidy, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the sink is outside, which is very convenient. The sound insulation is good and it's very quiet to sleep at night. The front desk service is enthusiastic and helps to store fruits that need to be refrigerated. There are three or four parking spaces in the hotel yard, and you can park for free. Breakfast is at the Qingfeng Baozi shop next door, with a coupon of 12 yuan per person, so you can live frugally and pay for the excess. The location is excellent, opposite the east gate of the University of International Business and Economics. There is a bus stop sign at the door, and transportation is convenient."
