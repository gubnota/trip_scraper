The surface of the table is just swept with a feather duster, and there are water and oil stains left by other guests before, and the window sill is smeared with black hands.\nThe most annoying thing is that I have to dry the washed clothes in the dryer. When I went downstairs, I saw two very unqualified middle-aged and elderly couples washing shoes in the washing machine and preparing to dry them. It was really disgusting. There are things like not letting underwear and shoes be washed. He also told me that he brushed it very clean, and it looked like it had just been taken out of the washing machine. After returning to the room, I called the front desk and told the front desk that someone was washing shoes in the washing machine and drying them in the dryer.\nBut she is still a skinny lady at the front desk who is on night shift, her attitude and service are very good.",
