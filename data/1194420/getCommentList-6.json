The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the fire-fighting equipment is very standard. Secondly, the transportation is convenient and the environment is quiet, which is rare. The breakfast for 18 yuan is quite rich, with a full range of proteins, carbohydrates, vegetables and fruits, and there is a restaurant at the door. There is a coffee counter in the lobby on the first floor with many seats. Friends who live in Guomao even came over to meet up, and it is not far away. I saw someone working in the lobby and all the sockets were available. This is my first time staying in Hanting. I have a very good impression. It is friendly and convenient!",
