        "content": "I stayed at the Hanting Hotel on a business trip with my colleagues. The overall feeling was pretty good. The room was clean and tidy. The lady at the front desk had a very good service attitude and made people feel very considerate. It is very close to Chaoyang Station and the train station. The transportation is very convenient, and there is a free ticket at the door. The parking lot is quite suitable for those who travel by car. There is a buffet breakfast on the first floor. It tastes pretty good. It is recommended to stay here."
