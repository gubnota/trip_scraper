        "content": "The location is good because it is close to Solana and Joyang Park, and for the price, it seems really good. The cost-effectiveness is truly excellent. However, the double bed is slightly smaller than the queen bed, so when a family of three with a child goes, it is very uncomfortable to sleep together because the bed is very small. That's a bit disappointing. Also, it is a bit disappointing that the soundproofing is not good. Other than those two problems, there is no fault."
