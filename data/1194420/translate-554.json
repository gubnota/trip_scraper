As soon as you enter the door, you will be disinfected and checked for temperature. The ladies at the front desk are very professional and enthusiastic. There are also robots that deliver meals, so you can get your meals without leaving your room. The room was also very clean and the stay was very comfortable. I was very satisfied with my stay and will come back often if I have the opportunity!"
