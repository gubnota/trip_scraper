        "content": "The location of this hotel is easy to find. On Yaojiayuan Road, there is a Big Yali Hotel at the door. It is only more than 800 meters away from the newly opened Chaoyang Railway Station. It is very quick to get off the car and walk there. There are many places to eat nearby. If you want to go shopping, you can go to Sanlitun or Chaoyang Joy City, which are very close. The front desk service is also great, and you will be given hot tea when you enter, which is very heartwarming. The room was very clean and comfortable. All in all, the price/performance ratio is very high and highly recommended!"
