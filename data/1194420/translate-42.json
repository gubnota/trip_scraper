        "content": "Relatives came to Beijing to visit and chose Hanting. It turned out that Hanting has been upgraded as a whole. It is no longer what it was in the impression a long time ago. While the environment is comfortable, the service is really patient and considerate! It has its own parking lot and life in the surrounding area is also very convenient. A great experience and very cost-effective!"
