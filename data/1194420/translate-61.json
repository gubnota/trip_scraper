        "content": "Facilities: Average. The company cooperates with the hotel for long-term business trips. I really hope the company can upgrade it.\n\nHygiene: Average. Every time the room is opened, there is a smell of oil smoke, which seems to come from the restaurant downstairs. It feels very uncomfortable.\n\nService: Average, quite satisfactory, overall efficiency is relatively fast, but you canâ€™t expect to be too satisfied."
