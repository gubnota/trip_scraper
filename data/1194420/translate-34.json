        "content": "I always stay at Hanting Hotel when I go out, and this time is no exception. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that there is a young lady at the front desk. We arrived at the hotel at almost 12 o'clock in the evening. My wife, children, and I sent our parents to the hotel (there was no extra time when there was no hotel). Then I booked a twin room with my wife and kids at the nearby Home Inn). When we checked in, the front desk was unfriendly and refused to let us send the elderly to the room. I complained for a long time, and finally made a face and kept emphasizing that we could not exceed For ten minutes, we felt like thieves. At that time, we felt very angry. I had never seen anything like this. There was only one waitress. The other girls at the front desk were very friendly when I met them the next day."
