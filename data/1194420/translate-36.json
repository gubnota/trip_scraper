        "content": "On the third day, I took the elders to have breakfast. There were many styles, and the taste was directly in line with foreign tourists. The elders at home had a very comfortable meal, and the price was very cheap. This is next to the high-speed rail station in the capital, and you can eat at this price. The breakfast was very difficult. The front desk also gave me water and told me that I didn't need to buy it specially. The room was cleaned in a timely manner. In short, it was a good stay here during my trip to Beijing. The price/performance ratio was very good. I hope foreign tourists can come here. There are many big restaurants nearby, and there is also a Sichuan restaurant, which is also good. The transportation is very convenient, and it is easy to find a taxi."
