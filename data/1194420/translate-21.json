        "content": "I booked this room for the elders in my family. It has a single bed and a double bed. The elders feel very comfortable sleeping. The room is spacious and well-equipped. Each room has a 65-inch TV. The elders and children can watch what just happened. Well, itâ€™s easy on the eyes.\n10 points out of 10. It is 1.5+-km away from Beijing Chaoyang Station. It is convenient and cost-effective. I will still book here next time I take my family to travelðŸ˜Š"
