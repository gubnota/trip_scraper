        "content": "Dear guest, thank you for choosing Hanting! After seeing your comment, the hotel immediately convened all front desk staff for a meeting and training. It was learned that on the day you checked in, you were dissatisfied with the hotel's one-time guest supplies being collected at the front desk because the government's Civilization Office issued a \"green consumption\" policy. It is advocated that disposable toiletries are not allowed to be placed in the room. At the same time, the hotel must meet the check-in needs of every passenger. Therefore, after checking in, guests can choose to collect disposable toiletries at the front desk. Thank you very much for your help. Understand and cooperate!"
