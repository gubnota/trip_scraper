There are not only board games for relaxation and entertainment in the lobby, but also a cafeteria for customers to use.\nThe hotel staff are very enthusiastic, considerate and patient in service - the front desk work is meticulous and considerate, the cleaning staff will take the initiative to greet customers while doing their job well, and the duty manager has a professional and conscientious service attitude.\nThe design of the guest room is still in a simple style, but there are all kinds of living utensils, and every part of the space is fully functional. What touched me was the various mirrors in the room. Among them, the magnifying mirror (not only for makeup, but also for checking whether the teeth are clean, very friendly to orthodontists) is my favorite, and I also like it The bedside lamp, the color of the light makes the room very warm.\nLooking forward to the next time I come to Beijing, I will stay at Huange Hotel again if I have the opportunity.","translatedLanguage":"en","translatedSource":"G","travelType":40,"travelTypeText":"Friends","rating":5,"ratingInfo":{"ratingAll":5,"ratingLocation":5,"ratingFacility":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoom":5,"commentLevel":"Outstanding"},"recommend":true,"imageList":["/0201812000ad0pezy4ABC.jpg","/0204p12000ad0px0y7809.jpg","/0204b12000ad0qrgn1AB3.jpg","/0202a12000ad0qeqj6F95.jpg"],"imageCuttingsList":[{"imageID":194865981,"imageStatus":0,"smallImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0201812000ad0pezy4ABC_W_350_350_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","mediumImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0201812000ad0pezy4ABC_C_600_600_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","bigImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0201812000ad0pezy4ABC_W_1280_853_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient"},{"imageID":194865983,"imageStatus":0,"smallImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0204p12000ad0px0y7809_W_350_350_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","mediumImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0204p12000ad0px0y7809_C_600_600_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","bigImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0204p12000ad0px0y7809_W_1280_853_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient"},{"imageID":194865985,"imageStatus":0,"smallImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0204b12000ad0qrgn1AB3_W_350_350_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","mediumImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0204b12000ad0qrgn1AB3_C_600_600_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","bigImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0204b12000ad0qrgn1AB3_W_1280_853_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient"},{"imageID":194865987,"imageStatus":0,"smallImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0202a12000ad0qeqj6F95_W_350_350_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","mediumImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0202a12000ad0qeqj6F95_C_600_600_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient","bigImageUrl":"http://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0202a12000ad0qeqj6F95_W_1280_853_R5_Q70.jpg?proc=autoorient"}],"videoList":[],"feedbackList":[{"type":3,"createDate":"2023-01-03 10:04:52","content":"開門不用房卡，看電視不用遙控器，連空調、燈光、窗帘都可以用手機控制。我們希望，住在CitiGO，是一件很“酷”的事情。感謝您對CitiGO的信任和喜歡，期待您的再次入住！","imageCuttingsList":[],"translatedContent":"You don’t need a room card to open the door, you don’t need a remote control to watch TV, and you can even control the air conditioner, lights, and curtains with your mobile phone.

The location is convenient. It is the closest hotel around Sanyuanqiao Station of the subway. You can walk for five minutes with luggage. From the Capital Airport, the rail transit airport line goes directly to the airport in half an hour. The surrounding environment is good. 2. The public facilities are complete, not to mention the conventional ones, as well as conference rooms (not open during the epidemic), gyms, free laundry rooms (with laundry and drying facilities), reading desks, books, billiards, vending machines, and robot pick-up. It is also very convenient to deliver takeout. The restaurant also offers free snacks for one hour per night. To be honest, I lived for three days and I used every item. 3. The front desk service is efficient, decent and polite. The cleaning staff took the initiative to say hello. 4. The room is really not big, it has all the functions, and the bathroom facilities are good. I saw a lot of comments about the small room before, and I almost didn't book it. Here, I will share my personal experience after the incident for the latecomers: the hotel itself is positioned as a city business travel, not a vacation type, and the hotel encourages the guests not to stay in the room but to go to the public areas and surrounding areas of the hotel through the booklet in the room. , which shows that the hotel has a precise and clear positioning of its own brand and the services it provides. Hotels are all about business travelers and city travelers, and every single point I've listed above is a reflection of that. One final tip: it’s even better if you can provide free or low-cost convenient coffee in the room or in the public area, which is what your target audience needs.
