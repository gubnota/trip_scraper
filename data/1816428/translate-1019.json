        "content": "You can really eat unlimited oranges at the Orange Hotel. The toiletries in the room are all orange-flavored. Things fell into the seam of the bed. When I opened the cabinet, the floor was clean. I can rest assured about the hygiene! After ordering takeout, the front desk asked a robot to deliver it to the room. It was very cool and full of technology. It is right on the edge of the Fourth Ring Road. There are car sellers next to it. Parking is free and the location is very good! The girl at the front desk is very friendly and sweet to talk to. Highly recommended! ! !"
