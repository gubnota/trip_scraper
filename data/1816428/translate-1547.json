        "content": "Hello dear guests! Thank you for staying at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and sharing your stay experience with us. We are very sorry that this stay did not bring you a more ideal stay experience. Since the hotel is located near the West Fourth Ring Road, considering the noise problem, all rooms in the hotel use double-layer soundproof glass. If there is enough room, we can adjust the location of the room for you, and the front desk also prepares disposable earplugs for guests. You can contact the front desk 24 hours a day to handle it for you. We will continue to improve all aspects and believe that you will have a better stay experience next time you stay. The hotel looks forward to your visit again and wishes you a happy life! General Manager: Li Changxia"
