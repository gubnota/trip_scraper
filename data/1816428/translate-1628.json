        "content": "Dear guest, first of all, thank you for choosing to stay at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel. We apologize that the hotel room facilities did not meet your expectations! Since the hotel has been renovated and opened for a long time, there is indeed a certain gap in room area and hardware facilities compared with newly opened stores. We are always working hard to improve the overall product. Recently, we have renovated and replaced the table lamps, basins and some furniture in the room. Wireless The network signal improvement is also coming to an end. We will do our best to provide good service and hygiene and provide you with a comfortable check-in environment. At the same time, if you have any comments or suggestions about our work during your check-in, you can contact us at any time. Please provide feedback to the staff and we will be waiting for you 24 hours a day. We also hope that you can see our changes when you stay again. All the hotel staff look forward to your every visit and wish you all the best! Manager: Ren Yuanyuan"
