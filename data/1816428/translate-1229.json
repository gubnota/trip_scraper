        "content": "The room is not big, but it is clean and tidy. It is very comfortable to live in. There is also a refrigerator, which is very convenient. The store's service attitude is also very good. They thoughtfully gave me a small gift when I checked in, and two bottles of warm mineral water when I left. It was very heartwarming to stay in the winter. There is Carrefour nearby, so it is very convenient to have dinner or supper in the evening."
