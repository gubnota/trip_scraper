        "content": "A very warm hotel, even a little touching! Here, the employees in every position, including the restaurant aunt and the electrician, are all equally considerate and enthusiastic. I can see a sincere smile on each of their faces! Although the room is a bit old, it is very clean. The bed is very comfortable, with down pillows and quilts. It is completely different from the beds in rooms at this price. The room is also equipped with a Bluetooth speaker. The room we stayed in is next to the road, but the double-layer windows are very soundproof. Can't hear anything outside! Highly recommend, great value for money!"
