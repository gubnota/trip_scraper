        "content": "The location is excellent. It takes 6 to 7 minutes to walk to the subway station. The hotel is well-equipped with a small refrigerator. The room is clean and tidy. It is very comfortable to stay. The young man named Peng at the front desk is very helpful and enthusiastic. He also packed some fruit biscuits. The breakfast is also good. There are many varieties. I personally think the price/performance ratio is quite high. I will stay in this hotel next time."
