Although the room is not big, it has everything you need.\nHygienic and clean, considerate service, breakfast is also OK\nThere are also flaws, such as the door handle being a bit difficult to pull open and the police being called frequently.\nFor example, facing the West Fourth Ring Road, with the windows open and noisy,\nBut when you close the window curtains, it's very quiet\nIn short, it is recommended to stay"
