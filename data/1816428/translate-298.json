        "content": "I stayed here for 10 days and the overall feeling is very good. This is the most comfortable stay I have had recently. I live on the third floor. The room staff are attentive, warm and considerate, and are always available when I call. The service staff in the restaurant take great care and are dedicated to their duties. Every time I go to eat in the morning, they are particularly enthusiastic and the service is attentive. What makes me feel particularly considerate is that the restaurant service staff take care of everyone's eating habits and make dining particularly enjoyable."
