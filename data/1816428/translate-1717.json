        "content": "Hello dear guests! Thank you for staying at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and sharing your stay experience with us. We are very sorry that this stay did not bring you a more ideal stay experience. Since the hotel has been open for a long time, the room facilities and hotel lobby have been gradually updated. We will definitely step up the update of all facilities. However, the overall construction of the rooms requires approval from the park where the hotel is located, so we will definitely step up communication. Next time you have the opportunity, you can try our \"Deluxe Suite\" room type. The space will be slightly larger. I believe it can bring you a better stay experience. I also hope that you can give us an apology next time you come over. Chance. Thank you for your valuable feedback. We will continue to improve all aspects. I believe you will have a better stay experience next time you stay. The hotel looks forward to your visit again and wishes you a happy life! General Manager: Zhang Xiangyun"
