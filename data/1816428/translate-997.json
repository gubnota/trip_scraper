        "content": "The location of the hotel is close to the subway station. It is very convenient to travel. As soon as I entered the lobby, I saw a large bowl of oranges, which are very sweet. This is great. The service attitude at the front desk is very good. Breakfast is available until 11 o'clock. For me, I have a habit of getting up late. People said it was very good, the variety was very rich, and the room facilities were complete. It was very good. I would choose this hotel next time!"
