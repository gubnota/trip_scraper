        "content": "Dear guest, thank you for staying at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and giving us the opportunity to serve you. Thank you very much for your recognition of the breakfast in the hotel. Only by staying well and eating well can you feel at home. The room key card can be placed in the groove sensor at the door to get electricity. From your comments, you agree with the overall experience of the hotel. However, we did not get your full approval, which proves that we still have shortcomings. We hope that you can check it out next time. Seeing our efforts, we will continue our efforts to provide you with a more comfortable and convenient stay experience. All hotel staff look forward to every encounter with you, and wish you all the best in your work! General Manager: Li Changxia"
