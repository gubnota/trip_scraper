        "content": "Dear guests: Hello! Thank you for choosing to stay at Orange Hotel Beijing Wukesong and sharing your stay experience despite your busy schedule! Xiaoju is very happy that the service and hygiene can be praised by you! Regarding your feedback about the lack of large lights in the room, since the hotel opened earlier, the room decoration style is different from the newly opened store. In order to provide better service to guests, other desk lamps are prepared at the front desk for guests to use. It is very difficult. I'm sorry that I didn't make you completely satisfied. If you need anything during your stay, you can contact the front desk at any time. We will always be by your side! We also sincerely hope that under the supervision of customers who care about our development like you, we can do better! wish you a happy life! Manager: Zhao Dan"
