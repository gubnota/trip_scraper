        "content": "The room is not big but well-equipped with everything you need. I stayed here for several days. The newly renovated self-service laundry room on the first floor is really convenient. There is also a clothes ironing machine next to it. There is a free unlimited supply of Coke and Sprite mineral water. It can be said that it is a great place to stay. They are very attentive. There are plenty of shared parking spaces in the car park. If you go out and ask for a coupon at the front desk, you can get it for free. It is very clean and the bed is very comfortable!"
