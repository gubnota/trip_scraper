        "content": "There are really oranges to eat at the Orange Hotel! Booked here because it's close to customers and because the service and breakfast are very good. The rooms here are not big, which may be a characteristic of Beijing, but the sanitation and facilities are good and the lobby is the best. It is suitable for waiting or short talks or meetings."
