        "content": "I stayed in this hotel for 3 days during my May Day trip. The room was very clean and I felt safe bringing my children in. The hotel is in a good location. It is opposite the subway station and there is a bus stop at the door. It is very convenient to go anywhere. The children are very interested in the food delivery robot in the store. It has a strong sense of technology and the breakfast variety is okay. However, there are many people during the peak meal period. Overall, it is a satisfactory recommendation."
