        "content": "The service attitude of the staff was very good. They also gave us drinks and biscuits. The location was easy to find. Parking was convenient and free. The bed and pillows were comfortable and the hygiene was OK. But the room was a bit small. The overall feeling was quite good. I would choose it again next time."

        "content": "Dear guests, hello! Thank you for sharing your stay experience with us despite your busy schedule. We are very honored that you spent time in the hotel. Our service, quality and details can be recognized by you, which also makes us feel warm in our hearts. It is our unremitting pursuit to make every guest feel at home. Due to the hotel decoration time, there is indeed a certain gap between the hotel room area and the newly opened store. Although the majong is small, the facilities in the room are complete, and the hotel rooms and public area supporting facilities can meet the needs. We will continue to work hard to meet your daily living needs and hope to bring you a more warm and comfortable accommodation environment. We look forward to your visit again! General Manager: Li Changxia"
