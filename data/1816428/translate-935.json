        "content": "I went to work around the hotel and stayed for one night. The hotel is in a good location. It's right on the roadside and is easy to find. The parking yard is large and parking is free. The room is very clean. The staff's attitude is also good and the service is very attentive. There are snacks at the front desk, you can eat fruit for free, and the takeout robot will deliver your order to the room. Technology changes life. I will recommend it to my friends and those in need."
