        "content": "The hotel is strategically located. There is a bus stop just a short walk away. Just across the overpass is Metro Line 6. Traveling is very convenient. The hotel facilities are quite new and complete. The service is even better, from the front desk to the cleaning lady. Very warm and polite, even helping with takeout. The front desk also delivers fruit every day, which is very considerate. All in all, it was a great stay experience. I stayed here for two nights. I will choose Orange Hotel as my first choice next time I come to Beijing."
