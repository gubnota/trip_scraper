        "content": "It feels pretty good, with complete facilities and good service attitude. It’s right at the entrance of a car park, and there’s also a food-delivery robot that’s so cute. It's very close to the subway station, only a two- to three-minute walk. The hotel lobby has a wide view and the accommodation environment is good! Hygiene is very reassuring, I will continue to choose it next time"
