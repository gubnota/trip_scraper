I am very sorry that I did not give you a perfect stay experience during your first stay. It was indeed such a good experience. As you said, the hotel rooms are slightly small and the room size cannot be changed. The room facilities have been gradually improved. We also hope to get your recognition in terms of service and hygiene. If you are not satisfied with anything during your stay, please feel free to contact us. Contact us and we will try our best to help you solve it. I hope you can see our efforts and progress and look forward to your visit again!"
