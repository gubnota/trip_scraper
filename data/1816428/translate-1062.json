        "content": "It is very close to the place where I travel, just on the side of the road. It shares the parking space with the 4S store that sells cars. Parking is free, which solves the problem of parking! The lobby seems to be newly renovated. Two large floor-to-ceiling windows can directly see the main road of the Fourth Ring Road, and the view is very broad! The room furnishings are quite satisfactory and complete. However, the hygiene is quite good, the bedding is very clean and comfortable, the staff is very friendly and responsive to all requests, and breakfast is provided when you check in on the same day. Highly recommended!"
