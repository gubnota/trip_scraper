        "content": "Hello dear guest! Thank you for staying at Orange Hotel Beijing Wukesong and sharing your stay experience! Thank you for your 5-star review for your satisfaction with the service and room hygiene! Due to the renovation time of the hotel, there is indeed a certain gap between the hotel room area and the newly opened store. Although the majong is small, the facilities in the room are complete. The hotel rooms and public area supporting facilities can meet your daily stay needs. We will continue to work hard. With the attentiveness of our work, we will exchange for your peace of mind and comfort when you check in. All the hotel staff look forward to your every visit and wish you a happy life. Hotel Manager: Zhao Dan"
