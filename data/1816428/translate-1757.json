Our hotel is located near the West Fourth Ring Auxiliary Road and Wuluju Station of Metro Line 6. You can go to the front desk to provide you with worry-free travel when you go out. The license plate number issued a free parking ticket. I am glad to know about the good impression this hotel left on you in the review. Before guests check in, we will conduct room rounds, clean the rooms and change the sheets to ensure that all guest supplies are changed \"one for each guest\". Please feel free to check in. It is our responsibility to provide you with high-quality services. Thank you for your support to us. We will continue to do a good job in all aspects and believe that you will have a better stay experience next time you check in. The hotel looks forward to your visit again and wishes you a happy life!"
