        "content": "Hello dear guests! Thank you for staying at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and sharing your stay experience with us. We are very sorry that this stay did not bring you a more ideal stay experience. Since the hotel has been open for a long time, the room facilities and hotel lobby have been gradually updated, but the overall construction of the room requires approval from the park where it is located. Next time you have the opportunity, you can experience our \"luxury suite\" room type, which will be slightly larger in space. I believe it can bring you a better stay experience. Thank you for your understanding. We will continue to improve all aspects. I believe you will have a better stay experience next time you stay. The hotel looks forward to your visit again and wishes you a happy life!"
