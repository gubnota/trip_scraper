        "content": "The location of the hotel is very good, close to the subway entrance, but the facilities in the room are a bit old, and the room is very small. The hotel is close to the Fourth Ring Road, which is more convenient if you drive by yourself, but it is still a bit noisy at night, although I brought earplugs. It felt better to stay at Crystal Orange before, but Orange Hotel is still a bit inferior in terms of service and hygiene."

        "content": "Dear guest, first of all, thank you for choosing to stay at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and leaving your review and feedback. Your comfort during your stay is our unchanging goal, but due to the size of the room, we are unable to give you a satisfactory stay experience. We apologize deeply. Due to the limitations of opening time and rental properties, there is indeed a certain gap between the hotel room area and the newly opened store. However, although the majong is small and well-equipped, the facilities in the room can meet your work needs when you are away from home, and the hotel room It is equipped with double-layer soundproof glass to block external noise. The self-service laundry room newly added by the hotel this year provides more convenience for guests on the road. Thank you for your review. All the hotel staff look forward to your visit again. I wish you all the best! Manager: Zhang Lijuan"
