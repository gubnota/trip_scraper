        "content": "Facilities: The facilities are quite intelligent, but I don’t quite understand why the Huazhuhui machine at the front desk has to be handled by the waiter every time. The switch beside the bed was unclear, so I pressed it randomly.\nHygiene: The bathroom has a bad smell, but other than that it's okay\nEnvironment: The parking space is shared with the park next to it. It is enough for parking, but it is a bit troublesome to have to say something every time you come in and out.\nService: The people at the front desk are very nice, but it’s best not to rush customers to write positive reviews."
