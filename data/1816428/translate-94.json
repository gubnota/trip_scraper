        "content": "The room I booked for a business trip is very close to the destination. It is only a ten-minute walk away. It is very convenient. The customer service attitude at the front desk is very enthusiastic and soft-spoken and friendly. The room is also very clean. I have sensitive constitution and I did not feel uncomfortable this time. It is great to have a robot from other places come to my door. !"
