The hotel is located on the West Fourth Ring Road, with very convenient transportation. It is very close to the 301 Hospital and the subway and bus stations. The hotel also provides free electronic parking tickets for travel. The route can be diversified according to your travel mode. At the same time, the room is equipped with complete facilities, electric curtains, refrigerated small refrigerator, and the hotel is equipped with double-layer soundproof glass.
