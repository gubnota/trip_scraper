        "content": "This is the worst Orange I have ever stayed in, bar none\nFirst, the facilities are extremely old and feel like a hotel from 10 years ago (the refrigerator is broken and they take it for granted)\nSecond, the space is extremely small, especially the toilet. The shower room and toilet space are very small.\nThird, there is basically no service. Before I went to Orange, I always got everything I asked for. If I didn’t have it, they would borrow it for me (if I couldn’t borrow it, they would call me to let me know). This one is for asking for nothing. The power of the hair dryer is very small; I asked for ice cubes and told me to ask for them. In the end, they didn’t send them to me or call me to inform me.\nFourth, this hotel is priced at an orange price, gives us ordinary and fast quality, and smashes the orange sign.\nToo bad"
