        "content": "I was most afraid of noise, but the room was very quiet, and the front desk staff were very friendly. There were 4S shops around, so I could go shopping when I had time. The morning time lasted until 11 o'clock, which is the greatest happiness for people who like lazy beds. Although the room Small, but very warm. The hotel delivers fruits every day, which is very warm."
