        "content": "Dear guest, thank you for staying at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and giving us the opportunity to serve you. The hotel is located in the Badelli Automobile Park near Haidian Wuluju Station on Metro Line 6. Parking is convenient. All rooms in the hotel are Bright and large windows with a wide view. We updated the entire hotel lobby area last year. The newly added lobby business area provides free online printing services for guests in need. There is also a snack and coffee area, where you can have a cup of fragrant freshly ground coffee during your afternoon leisure time. Coffee and warm tea will bring you comfort and relaxation. There is a laundry room on the first floor of the hotel, which provides 24-hour free self-service laundry service for staying guests. We have recently updated the curtains, lamps, toiletries and brand-new bedding in the room for a comfortable stay. Experience is our unchanging goal and we are constantly working hard to achieve this goal. We look forward to your next stay! Manager: Zhao Dan"
