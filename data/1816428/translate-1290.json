        "content": "The hotel is in an alley. If you drive there, you can get free parking if you report your license plate number. The service is very good and the hotel environment is nice. When I went there, there were oranges to eat, and I was given a Sprite and a Coke. The check-in experience was quite good. The key is the cleanliness of the hotel. I don't think anything else is as important as this."
