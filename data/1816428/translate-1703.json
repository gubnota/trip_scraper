We are very sorry that this stay did not bring you a more ideal stay experience. Since the hotel has been open for a long time, the room facilities and hotel lobby have been gradually updated. We will definitely step up the update of all facilities. We also hope that you can give us a chance to apologize to you next time you come. Thank you for your valuable feedback. We will continue to improve all aspects. I believe you will have a better stay experience next time you stay. The hotel looks forward to your visit again and wishes you a happy life!
