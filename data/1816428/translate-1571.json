Your satisfaction during your stay is our constant pursuit. Due to the renovation time, there is indeed a certain gap between the hotel room area and the newly opened store. However, although the hotel is small and well-equipped, the room and public area supporting facilities can meet your daily living needs. We will continue to work hard and exchange our careful work for you. Feel safe and comfortable when checking in. All the hotel staff look forward to your every visit and wish you a happy life. Hotel General Manager: Zhang Xiangyun"
