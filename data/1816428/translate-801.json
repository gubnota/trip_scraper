        "content": "A word of praise is enough to make us feel grateful. Only by continuing to work hard can we live up to our expectations. Thank you for choosing to stay at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and for commenting and approving the hotelâ€™s location and breakfast options. Your support is the greatest encouragement to our work. The hotel is only 200 meters away from Haidian Wuluju Station on Metro Line 6 and 30 meters away. Minutes directly to scenic spots such as Nanluogu Lane, and a taxi ride from the South Ruyi Gate of the Summer Palace is about 20 yuan. Thank you for your support. All the hotel staff look forward to your visit every time, and wish you all the best in your work! Manager: Ren Yuanyuan"
