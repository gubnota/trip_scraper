        "content": "Hello dear guests! Thank you for staying at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and sharing your stay experience with us. We are very sorry that this stay did not bring you a more ideal stay experience. Indeed, as you said, since the hotel has been open for a long time, the room area is slightly smaller. The room facilities and hotel lobby here have been gradually updated. We will definitely step up the update of all facilities, but the overall construction of the room requires approval from the park where it is located. We will also definitely step up communication. Next time you can experience the \"Deluxe Suite\" room type, and I very much hope that you can give us a chance to apologize to you next time you come over. We will continue to improve all aspects and believe that you will have a better stay experience next time you stay. The hotel looks forward to your visit again and wishes you a happy life! General Manager: Li Changxia"
