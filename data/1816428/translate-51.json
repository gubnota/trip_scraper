        "content": "The room is small, a bit crowded, and the facilities are a bit outdated. The bedding was quite comfortable, and orange juice was available, but it wasn't orange juice, and it wasn't available all the time. It is also recommended to change your shampoo to a tear-free one. The service was pretty good."
