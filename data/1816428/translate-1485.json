        "content": "Dear guest, first of all, thank you for choosing to stay at Orange Beijing Wukesong Hotel and for your affirmation of service and cleanliness. Your comfort during your stay is our unchanging goal. However, due to the size of the room, we are unable to give you a satisfactory stay. We sincerely apologize for the check-in experience. Due to the limitations of the opening time and rental properties, there is indeed a certain gap in the hotel room area compared with the newly opened stores. However, although the majong is small and well-equipped, the facilities in the room can meet your work needs when you are away from home. The hotel's new self-service laundry room this year provides more convenience for guests on the road. Thank you for your review. All hotel staff look forward to your visit again and wish you all the best! Manager: Ren Yuanyuan"
